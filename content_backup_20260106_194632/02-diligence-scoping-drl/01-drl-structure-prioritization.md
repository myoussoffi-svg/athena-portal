# Diligence Request List (DRL): Structure & Prioritization

## Outcomes
- Build a DRL that is scoped, prioritized, and decision-driven.
- Separate critical diligence from noise under tight timelines.
- Use the DRL as a management tool, not a document dump.

## Agenda
- Understand the purpose of the DRL in the deal process.
- Structure the DRL by decision category, not data type.
- Prioritize requests based on risk, impact, and timing.
- Manage scope, pushback, and escalation during diligence.

## Why this matters in a real deal
A poorly constructed DRL wastes time, frustrates management, and obscures real risk. A strong DRL does the opposite: it focuses the diligence team on what actually matters, surfaces red flags early, and enables clean decision-making.

IC does not care how many requests you sent. They care whether you identified the right risks, validated the thesis, and escalated issues early enough to act.

## Deliverable
- Produce a structured DRL that:
  - Is organized by diligence objective (not function).
  - Clearly distinguishes critical vs. confirmatory requests.
  - Identifies timing dependencies and escalation triggers.
- Include a short note explaining which 5–10 requests matter most and why.

## Checklist
- [ ] Requests are tied to specific risks, assumptions, or thesis components.
- [ ] The DRL can be explained and defended in a five-minute internal walkthrough.
- [ ] Critical-path items are clearly identified and front-loaded.
- [ ] Low-value or duplicative requests are intentionally excluded.
- [ ] Escalation triggers are defined for missing or concerning data.

## 1) Understand the purpose of the DRL
The DRL is not a comprehensive data wish list. It is a **risk management and decision tool**.

A good DRL answers three questions:
- What could cause us to walk away?
- What must be true for the thesis to hold?
- What information do we need *now* versus later?

If a request does not help answer one of these, it should not be prioritized.

---

## 2) Structure the DRL by decision category
Avoid organizing the DRL purely by function (finance, legal, HR). That structure mirrors internal teams, not investment decisions.

Instead, group requests by **decision area**, such as:
- Revenue quality and sustainability
- Customer concentration and retention
- Margin drivers and cost structure
- Growth opportunities and constraints
- Operational scalability and risks
- Legal, regulatory, and compliance exposure

This makes it easier to:
- assess completeness
- identify gaps
- explain diligence status internally

---

## 3) Separate critical requests from confirmatory requests
Not all diligence is equal.

### Critical requests
These test:
- thesis validity
- downside risk
- deal-breakers

Examples:
- Customer churn and cohort data
- Contract terms for top customers
- Unit economics by product or customer segment
- Regulatory exposure tied to core revenue

### Confirmatory requests
These:
- validate known information
- reduce uncertainty
- support documentation

Examples:
- Historical financial schedules already summarized elsewhere
- Standard policy documents
- Supporting detail for immaterial line items

**Rule of thumb:** If a request would not change the decision, it is not critical.

---

## 4) Prioritize by risk, impact, and timing
Each request should be evaluated across three dimensions:

### Risk
- What happens if this data reveals a problem?
- Could it materially affect valuation, structure, or go/no-go?

### Impact
- How central is this information to the investment thesis?
- Does it affect growth, margin, or exit assumptions?

### Timing
- When do we need this to make decisions?
- Is it a gating item for later workstreams?

High-risk, high-impact, early-timing items should be at the top of the DRL and followed up aggressively.

---

## 5) Manage scope and pushback
Management teams will push back. This is expected.

Your job is not to win every request — it is to **protect decision quality**.

When you get pushback:
- Clarify the decision the request supports.
- Offer alternatives (summary data, samples, staged delivery).
- Escalate internally if a critical request is resisted.

Silently dropping a critical request is a failure.

---

## 6) Use the DRL as a live management tool
The DRL should evolve as diligence progresses.

Best practices:
- Track status, owner, and timing for each request.
- Flag items that are late, incomplete, or concerning.
- Update priorities as new risks emerge.
- Use the DRL to drive weekly diligence check-ins.

A static DRL signals passive diligence. An actively managed DRL signals control.

---

## What goes into the internal walkthrough
When briefing your deal team, be prepared to cover:
- The top 5–10 requests and why they matter.
- What you are waiting on and what is blocking progress.
- Early red flags and how you are validating them.
- What you will do if key data does not arrive.

This is how associates earn trust during diligence.

---

## Synthesis
- Which single request, if unanswered, would make you uncomfortable signing an LOI?
- What information would most likely change valuation or structure?
- What request would you escalate immediately if management resisted?
