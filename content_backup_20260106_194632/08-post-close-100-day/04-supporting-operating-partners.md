## Learning Objectives

- Diagnose potential conflicts between operating partner recommendations and management preferences
- Structure project plans and communication protocols when operating partners lead value creation initiatives
- Defend operating partner engagement scope and resource allocation when management resists external involvement

## Written Guide

### What are Operating Partners

**Operating partners** are former executives (CEOs, COOs, CFOs) who work with PE firms to support portfolio companies.

**Typical models**:
- **Full-time employed**: Work exclusively for the PE firm
- **Part-time advisors**: Engage on specific deals or initiatives
- **Executive-in-residence**: Available for projects on retainer

**Expertise areas**: Functional (sales, operations, technology) or sector-specific (healthcare, software, manufacturing)

### When to Involve Operating Partners

**Post-close scenarios**:

**1. Management capability gaps**

Company needs CFO-level finance expertise but cannot afford full-time hire yet. Operating partner provides interim CFO support.

**2. Specialized initiatives**

Pricing optimization, ERP implementation, M&A integration require domain expertise management lacks.

**3. Rapid growth or transformation**

Company is scaling 50%+ annually and needs operational playbooks.

**4. Underperformance or crisis**

Revenue is declining, and management does not have turnaround experience.

### Associate Role in Supporting Operating Partners

**1. Coordination and project management**

- Schedule meetings between operating partner and management
- Track project milestones
- Escalate blockers

**2. Data and analysis**

- Provide operating partner with financial data, KPIs, org charts
- Conduct analysis to support recommendations (e.g., pricing sensitivity modeling)

**3. Communication bridge**

- Translate between operating partner (operational lens) and investment team (returns lens)
- Ensure alignment on priorities

**4. Implementation tracking**

- Monitor whether management is executing operating partner recommendations
- Report progress to investment team

### Managing Tensions Between Operating Partners and Management

**Common friction points**:

**1. Management feels undermined**

CEO perceives operating partner as "PE firm doesn't trust me."

**Solution**: Position operating partner as resource, not replacement. "You have successfully built this business to $50M. Scaling to $150M requires different capabilities. Operating partner has done this 3 times."

**2. Operating partner recommendations conflict with management instincts**

Operating partner: "Fire bottom 20% of sales reps."
CEO: "These reps have long tenure; I don't want to lose institutional knowledge."

**Associate role**: Facilitate discussion. Present data (sales productivity by rep). Help CEO and operating partner find common ground or escalate to VP for decision.

**3. Operating partner overwhelms management with initiatives**

Operating partner proposes 15 projects. Management cannot execute all.

**Associate role**: Prioritize. Use impact/effort framework. Recommend phasing (Months 1–3: Initiatives A, B, C; Months 4–6: Initiatives D, E).

### Structuring Operating Partner Engagements

**Engagement scoping**:

**1. Define objectives**

"Improve sales efficiency: Increase quota attainment from 60% to 75% within 6 months."

**2. Define scope**

- Sales process redesign
- Comp plan optimization
- Sales enablement tools

**3. Define time commitment**

2 days per month for 6 months

**4. Define success metrics**

Quota attainment, sales cycle length, CAC payback

**5. Define governance**

Operating partner reports to VP; meets with CEO biweekly; presents findings at quarterly board meetings.

**Associate responsibility**: Draft engagement scope, track deliverables, manage budget (if operating partner is external consultant).

## Key Takeaways

- Operating partners are former executives who provide specialized expertise in functional areas (sales, ops, finance) or sectors (healthcare, software, manufacturing)
- Involve operating partners when management has capability gaps, specialized initiatives require domain expertise, rapid growth demands scaling playbooks, or underperformance needs turnaround support
- Associates coordinate projects, provide data and analysis, bridge communication between operating partners and investment teams, and track implementation progress
- Manage tensions by positioning operating partners as resources (not replacements), facilitating data-driven discussions on conflicting recommendations, and prioritizing initiatives to avoid overwhelming management
- Structure engagements with clear objectives, scope, time commitment, success metrics, and governance—associates draft scopes, track deliverables, and manage budgets
- Operating partners add most value when properly scoped, management is receptive, and associates ensure recommendations are executed rather than shelved
