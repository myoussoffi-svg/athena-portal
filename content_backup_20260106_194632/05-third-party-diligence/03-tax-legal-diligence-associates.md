## Written Guide

### Why Tax and Legal Diligence Matter for Associates

Tax and legal diligence are often perceived as "back-office" workstreams that do not affect the core investment thesis. This is a mistake.

**Tax diligence impacts**:
- Deal structure (asset vs. stock, use of blockers, rollover equity treatment)
- Net returns to the fund (tax leakage reduces IRR)
- Cash flow and distribution timing

**Legal diligence impacts**:
- Identification of undisclosed liabilities (litigation, regulatory violations)
- Assessment of contract enforceability and termination risks
- IP ownership and protection
- Required reps, warranties, and indemnities in the SPA

Associates are not expected to be tax or legal experts, but you must understand enough to:
- Ask the right questions of advisors
- Identify findings that require escalation
- Integrate tax and legal considerations into the deal narrative

### Tax Diligence: What Associates Need to Know

**Tax diligence is conducted by**: Big 4 accounting firms or specialized tax boutiques

**Typical scope**:

1. **Tax structure recommendation**: Asset vs. stock purchase; use of acquisition entities or blockers

2. **Historical tax compliance review**: Confirm the company has filed returns and paid taxes correctly

3. **Tax attribute analysis**: Net operating losses (NOLs), credits, or other tax assets

4. **Uncertain tax positions**: Identify aggressive tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities

5. **State and local tax (SALT) issues**: Nexus, sales tax compliance, property tax

6. **International tax**: Transfer pricing, foreign tax credits, repatriation

**Deliverables**:
- Tax structuring memo (typically early in diligence)
- Tax due diligence report (final findings)

### Asset vs. Stock Purchase: Why It Matters

**Stock purchase**:
- Buyer acquires the entity and inherits all historical liabilities (including unknown tax liabilities)
- No step-up in asset basis (no incremental tax depreciation)
- Simpler transaction structure

**Asset purchase**:
- Buyer acquires specific assets and assumes only specified liabilities
- Step-up in asset basis (tax depreciation increases, reducing future taxable income and increasing after-tax cash flow)
- More complex transaction structure; may trigger tax to the seller

**Tax advisor recommendation**:
The tax advisor will model the after-tax returns under both structures and recommend the optimal approach.

**Your role**:
- Understand the high-level trade-offs
- Incorporate tax depreciation and deferred tax impacts into the financial model
- Understand whether the seller will accept an asset deal (often they prefer stock to avoid tax consequences)

**Red flag**: If tax advisor recommends asset purchase but seller refuses, you may need to adjust valuation to account for the lack of step-up basis (typically worth 5–10% of purchase price in NPV terms).

### Historical Tax Compliance: What to Watch For

**Tax advisor reviews**:
- Past 3–5 years of tax returns
- Open audits or disputes with tax authorities
- Sales tax, payroll tax, property tax compliance

**Key findings to escalate**:

**1. Unpaid taxes or late filing penalties**

Indicates weak financial controls or liquidity issues. May require adjustment to purchase price or escrow.

**2. Aggressive or unsupportable tax positions**

Example: Company claimed R&D tax credits that do not meet IRS criteria.

**Risk**: IRS could challenge and require repayment plus interest. This should be addressed through indemnity or escrow.

**3. Sales tax nexus issues**

Common in e-commerce or multi-state businesses. Company may owe back sales taxes in states where it has nexus but did not collect/remit taxes.

**Risk**: Can be a material liability (millions in back taxes). Quantify exposure and include in net debt calculation or negotiate indemnity.

**4. Transfer pricing issues (for international businesses)**

If the company has cross-border transactions with related entities, transfer pricing must be defensible. If not, tax authorities could re-characterize income and assess additional tax.

**Your role**: Flag these issues to your VP and ensure they are reflected in the SPA as seller reps/warranties or indemnified items.

### Legal Diligence: What Associates Need to Know

**Legal diligence is conducted by**: Outside law firm (often the same firm acting as deal counsel)

**Typical scope**:

1. **Corporate organization and governance**: Confirm the company is properly formed, capitalized, and in good standing

2. **Material contracts review**: Customer contracts, supplier agreements, leases, financing agreements

3. **Litigation and disputes**: Active lawsuits, threatened claims, regulatory investigations

4. **Intellectual property**: Patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets; ownership and infringement risks

5. **Regulatory compliance**: Industry-specific regulations (healthcare, financial services, etc.)

6. **Employment and benefits**: Employment agreements, non-competes, benefits plans, labor issues

7. **Environmental**: Environmental assessments (Phase I/Phase II) for businesses with real estate or manufacturing

**Deliverables**:
- Legal due diligence report (comprehensive summary of findings and risks)

### Material Contracts: What to Focus On

Legal diligence will review hundreds of contracts. Prioritize:

**1. Customer contracts (top 20 by revenue)**

- **Termination rights**: Can the customer exit without cause? What is the notice period?
- **Change of control provisions**: Does a PE acquisition trigger termination rights or consent requirements?
- **Pricing and escalation**: Are prices locked in, or subject to annual increases?
- **Auto-renewal vs. fixed term**

**Red flag**: Top customer contract allows termination for convenience with 30-day notice. This is high revenue risk.

**2. Supplier or vendor agreements**

- **Single-source dependencies**: Are there critical suppliers with no alternatives?
- **Exclusivity or minimum purchase commitments**: Does the company have obligations that limit flexibility?
- **Change of control provisions**

**Red flag**: Exclusive supplier contract can be terminated at change of control. Supplier could demand renegotiation post-close.

**3. Leases (real estate, equipment)**

- **Remaining term and renewal options**
- **Rent escalations**
- **Tenant improvement allowances or lease incentives**

**Red flag**: HQ lease expires in 12 months with no renewal option. Relocation could be disruptive and costly.

**4. Debt or financing agreements**

- **Change of control provisions**: Does the deal trigger repayment or consent requirements?
- **Prepayment penalties**
- **Covenants**

**Red flag**: Existing debt has change of control clause requiring immediate repayment at close. Must be refinanced or paid off (included in sources/uses).

### Litigation and Regulatory Risks

**Legal diligence will identify**:
- Active lawsuits (plaintiff or defendant)
- Threatened claims or demand letters
- Regulatory investigations or enforcement actions

**Your role**:

**1. Assess materiality**

- **Low materiality**: Customer dispute over $50K invoice. Annoying but not material.
- **High materiality**: Class action lawsuit claiming product defect with potential damages of $10M+.

**2. Understand the status and likely outcome**

- Is the case early-stage or nearing resolution?
- What is legal counsel's view of likely outcome?
- Is there insurance coverage?

**3. Ensure appropriate SPA protections**

- Seller should represent no undisclosed litigation
- Escrow or indemnity should cover litigation risks if quantifiable
- If litigation is significant, it may be a pass/restructure situation

**Red flag**: Management failed to disclose a material lawsuit during diligence. Escalate immediately as a credibility issue.

### Intellectual Property: Ownership and Infringement

**Legal diligence will assess**:
- Does the company own or license its core IP?
- Are IP registrations (patents, trademarks) up to date?
- Is there risk of third-party infringement claims?
- Are employee IP assignment agreements in place?

**Red flags**:

**1. IP is owned by founder, not the company**

Founder must assign IP to the company before close, or the deal may not close.

**2. Company is using third-party IP without proper license**

Example: Using open-source software in violation of license terms. Could result in forced disclosure of proprietary code or cease-and-desist.

**3. Infringement claim threatened by competitor**

Patent troll or competitor claims the company's product infringes their IP. Could result in litigation, licensing fees, or product redesign.

**Your action**: Ensure IP ownership is cleaned up pre-close. Include reps and warranties on IP ownership and non-infringement in SPA.

### Environmental Diligence (Phase I and Phase II)

For businesses with real estate, manufacturing, or industrial operations, environmental diligence assesses contamination risk.

**Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA)**:
- Desktop review of property history, prior uses, and environmental records
- Visual site inspection
- Identifies recognized environmental conditions (RECs)

**Phase II ESA** (if Phase I identifies concerns):
- Soil and groundwater testing
- Quantifies contamination levels

**Outcome**:

- **No issues**: Phase I clean, no RECs. Proceed.
- **Minor issues**: Historical dry cleaning on-site; contamination is contained and de minimis. Manageable with seller indemnity.
- **Major issues**: Soil contamination requires remediation costing $2M+. Either reduce purchase price, require seller to remediate, or pass.

**Your role**: Understand environmental findings and ensure remediation obligations are clear in the SPA.

### Coordinating Tax and Legal with Deal Counsel

Tax and legal diligence advisors are separate from deal counsel, but findings must be coordinated.

**Flow**:

1. **Tax/legal advisors** conduct diligence and produce reports

2. **Associate** reviews findings and flags material issues for VP

3. **VP and principal** work with **deal counsel** to translate findings into SPA terms:
   - Reps and warranties
   - Indemnities and escrows
   - Conditions to closing (e.g., "IP must be assigned to the company")

4. **Deal counsel** negotiates with seller's counsel

**Your role**:
- Ensure tax and legal findings are shared with deal counsel promptly
- Track which issues are addressed in the SPA and which remain open
- Maintain a tracker of legal/tax follow-ups

### When to Escalate Tax or Legal Issues

**Escalate immediately if**:

1. **Material undisclosed liability** (litigation, tax liability, environmental issue)

2. **Regulatory non-compliance that could result in shutdown** (operating without required licenses, safety violations)

3. **IP ownership unclear or disputed**

4. **Tax structuring issues that materially affect returns** (e.g., cannot achieve asset treatment, unexpected tax leakage)

5. **Seller refuses to provide standard reps/warranties** (suggests they are hiding something)

**Escalation path**: Associate → VP → Principal → Deal Counsel / Fund Counsel
