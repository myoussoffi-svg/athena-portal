# Synthesizing Advisor Findings

## Learning Objectives

- Explain how to distill multiple third-party advisor reports (QofE, market, legal, tax) into concise, decision-ready summaries for VPs and IC
- Evaluate which advisor findings are IC-critical versus supporting detail and structure outputs accordingly
- Develop frameworks for translating technical advisor language into business implications that inform valuation, risk, and deal structure
- Diagnose when advisor reports contain conflicting conclusions and facilitate resolution through follow-up questions or internal analysis
- Structure one-page advisor summaries and integrated findings memos that enable rapid comprehension by decision-makers
- Defend synthesis conclusions when advisors may disagree with how their findings are characterized or prioritized

## Written Guide

### Why Advisor Synthesis is a Core Associate Responsibility

Third-party advisors produce comprehensive reports:
- **QofE report**: 50–100 pages
- **Market study**: 40–80 pages
- **Legal diligence**: 30–60 pages
- **Tax memo**: 20–40 pages

**Total**: 140–280 pages of technical analysis.

Your VP and IC do not have time to read 200+ pages. They need you to:
1. **Extract the key findings** from each report
2. **Translate technical language** into business implications
3. **Connect the dots** across reports
4. **Flag decision-critical issues** and propose next steps

Associates who excel at synthesis become indispensable. Those who forward 200 pages of PDFs without summary create work for their VPs rather than solving problems.

### The One-Page Advisor Summary

For each third-party report, create a one-page summary.

**Template structure**:

**Advisor**: [Firm name, e.g., Deloitte QofE]

**Scope**: [What they reviewed]

**Key Findings** (3–5 bullets):
- Finding 1 (most important)
- Finding 2
- Finding 3

**Material Adjustments or Risks**:
- EBITDA adjustment: $X
- Valuation impact: [Describe]
- Legal/tax risk: [Quantify if possible]

**Implications for Deal**:
- [How does this affect thesis, valuation, structure, or IC recommendation?]

**Outstanding Items**:
- [What follow-ups are needed?]

**Example: QofE One-Pager**

**Advisor**: Deloitte Quality of Earnings

**Scope**: Reviewed FY21–FY23 financials, normalized EBITDA, revenue quality, working capital

**Key Findings**:
- Adjusted EBITDA is $10.2M vs. management-reported $11.0M ($800K adjustment)
- Primary adjustments: $500K non-recurring legal settlement expense (add-back), $1.3M aggressive revenue pull-forward (deduction)
- Gross margin compressed 300 bps over 3 years due to product mix shift toward lower-margin offerings
- Working capital normalized at $2.5M (vs. current $1.8M); company has deferred vendor payments

**Material Adjustments**:
- EBITDA: -$800K
- Working capital: +$700K (will reduce cash to seller at close)

**Implications for Deal**:
- Lower EBITDA reduces valuation by ~$8M at 10× multiple
- Revenue quality risk (pull-forward); forward projections should be conservative
- Working capital true-up will reduce proceeds to seller

**Outstanding Items**:
- Management disputes the $1.3M revenue adjustment; discussion pending

This one-pager allows your VP to grasp the QofE findings in 2 minutes.

### Translating Technical Language into Business Implications

Advisors use technical jargon. Your job is to translate.

**Technical language** (from QofE report):
"The company capitalizes software development costs under ASC 350-40. We identified $400K in capitalized costs that did not meet the capitalization criteria and should have been expensed."

**Translation for VP**:
"QofE found that the company improperly capitalized $400K in software costs, inflating EBITDA. Correcting this reduces EBITDA by $400K."

**Why translation matters**: VPs and IC members are not accountants. They need to know the business impact, not the accounting standard citation.

**More examples**:

| Advisor Language | Business Translation |
|------------------|----------------------|
| "Revenue recognition policy is aggressive under ASC 606" | "Company is recognizing revenue earlier than industry standard, creating risk of future restatement or revenue decline" |
| "NOLs are subject to Section 382 limitation" | "Tax loss carryforwards will be limited post-acquisition, reducing their value by ~50%" |
| "Material adverse change (MAC) clause is narrow" | "Seller has limited obligation to close if business deteriorates; buyer bears more risk between signing and closing" |
| "IP ownership is unclear for certain pre-2020 inventions" | "Company may not own all IP it uses; could face infringement claims or licensing costs" |

### Integrating Findings Across Advisors

After creating one-pagers for each advisor, synthesize into an integrated findings memo.

**Integrated Findings Memo Structure** (2–3 pages):

**1. Executive Summary** (0.5 page)

- Adjusted EBITDA: $[X] (vs. management $[Y])
- Key risks: [Top 3 risks across all workstreams]
- Recommendation: [Proceed / Restructure / Pass]

**2. Financial Findings** (0.5 page)

- QofE-adjusted EBITDA and key adjustments
- Revenue quality and sustainability
- Working capital normalization

**3. Commercial Findings** (0.5 page)

- Market size, growth, competitive positioning (from market study)
- Customer concentration and retention risk
- Pricing dynamics

**4. Legal and Tax Findings** (0.5 page)

- Material legal risks (litigation, IP, contracts)
- Tax structure and implications
- Compliance issues

**5. Integrated Risk Assessment** (0.5 page)

- Cross-workstream risks (see prior lesson)
- Aggregate downside quantification
- Proposed mitigants

**6. Outstanding Items and Next Steps** (0.25 page)

- What remains unresolved
- Timeline for final advisor deliverables

### Handling Conflicting Advisor Conclusions

Sometimes advisors contradict each other.

**Example conflict**:

**QofE**: "Revenue is sustainable. No adjustment required."
**Market study**: "Customer interviews indicate 3 of top 10 customers are considering switching to competitors."

**Your action**:

1. **Identify the conflict explicitly**: Do not ignore it or assume one advisor is right.

2. **Facilitate a discussion**: Schedule a call with both advisors (or escalate to VP to facilitate). Ask:
   - "QofE, you concluded revenue is sustainable. Market study found customers are at risk. How do you reconcile?"
   - "Market study, do the customer concerns you identified affect revenue in the near term?"

3. **Form your own view**: Based on the discussion and your diligence, determine which perspective is more credible.

4. **Reflect the conflict in your memo**: "QofE concluded revenue is sustainable, but market study customer interviews suggest retention risk. We recommend conservative revenue assumptions given conflicting signals."

**Do not hide conflicts**. IC needs to know when advisors disagree.

### Red Flags in Advisor Reports

**Red Flag 1: Advisor hedges or equivocates**

Language like "we were unable to conclude," "insufficient data," or "outside our scope" suggests the advisor could not complete their work or found issues they do not want to opine on.

**Your action**: Probe. What specifically is unresolved? Can it be resolved with additional data or time? If not, escalate as a gap.

**Red Flag 2: Advisor findings are overly positive with no risks flagged**

If every advisor report concludes "no issues identified," this is suspicious. Every business has risks.

**Your action**: Ask the advisor directly, "What are the top 2–3 risks you identified, even if they are manageable?" Push them to surface nuance.

**Red Flag 3: Advisor scope was too narrow**

Example: Legal diligence reviewed only executed contracts but did not review in-flight negotiations or LOIs with customers.

**Your action**: Identify the scope gap and determine whether it is material. If yes, expand scope or conduct internal follow-up.

**Red Flag 4: Advisor findings conflict with VDR data or management statements**

Example: Tax advisor says no outstanding tax liabilities, but you found an IRS notice in the VDR.

**Your action**: Escalate immediately. Either the advisor missed something, or the VDR document is not what it appears.

### Preparing Advisor Summaries for IC Presentation

Your VP will likely present at IC, but you may be asked to prepare the backup slides or appendix materials.

**IC Backup Slides: Advisor Summary Format**

**Slide Title**: Third-Party Diligence Summary

**Table Format**:

| Workstream | Advisor | Key Findings | EBITDA / Valuation Impact | Risk Level |
|------------|---------|--------------|---------------------------|------------|
| QofE | Deloitte | Adjusted EBITDA $10.2M (mgmt $11.0M); revenue quality risk | -$800K EBITDA | Medium |
| Market | Bain | TAM $8B growing 10%; company at 2% share; competitive pressure increasing | No direct impact | Medium |
| Legal | Kirkland | No material litigation; IP ownership clean; top customer contract renewal in 6 months | Potential downside if renewal fails | Medium-High |
| Tax | PwC | Recommend asset structure; $1M step-up benefit; no historical tax issues | +$1M NPV benefit | Low |

This slide allows IC to scan all advisor findings in one view.

### When Advisors Push Back on Your Synthesis

Sometimes advisors will object to how you characterized their findings.

**Example**:

You write in the IC memo: "QofE identified material revenue quality concerns."

QofE advisor responds: "We did not say 'material concerns.' We flagged an item for follow-up."

**How to handle**:

1. **Clarify with the advisor**: "Can you help me understand the severity? Is this something IC should be concerned about, or is it minor?"

2. **Revise if warranted**: If you over-stated the finding, correct it.

3. **Stand your ground if appropriate**: If the advisor is downplaying a real issue, discuss with your VP and decide whether to hold the characterization.

**Guiding principle**: Be fair and accurate, but do not let advisors sanitize findings to avoid discomfort.

### Final Checklist: Is Your Synthesis IC-Ready?

Before finalizing advisor synthesis, ask:

1. **Is it concise?** Can a busy partner read your summary in 5 minutes and understand the key points?

2. **Is it actionable?** Does it inform a decision (proceed, restructure, pass)?

3. **Is it integrated?** Have you connected findings across advisors rather than presenting them in silos?

4. **Are conflicts surfaced?** If advisors disagree, is that explicit?

5. **Are risks quantified?** Have you translated findings into financial impacts where possible?

6. **Are next steps clear?** Does the reader know what remains outstanding?

If yes to all, your synthesis is IC-ready.
