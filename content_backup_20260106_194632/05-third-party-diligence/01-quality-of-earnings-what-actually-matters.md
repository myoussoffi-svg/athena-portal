# Quality of Earnings: What Actually Matters

## Learning Objectives

- Explain the purpose and scope of a quality of earnings (QofE) report and how it differs from an audit
- Evaluate which QofE adjustments are material versus technical and prioritize review accordingly
- Develop frameworks for interpreting EBITDA normalization adjustments and assessing their credibility
- Diagnose red flags in QofE findings including aggressive revenue recognition, non-recurring add-backs, or working capital anomalies
- Structure the QofE engagement process including scoping, interim check-ins, and integration of findings into financial models

- Identify when to escalate QofE concerns to VPs, principals, or legal counsel based on severity and implications for valuation

## Written Guide

### What is a Quality of Earnings Report and Why It Matters

A Quality of Earnings (QofE) report is an independent financial analysis conducted by a third-party accounting firm (typically Big 4 or specialized boutiques) that assesses the sustainability, accuracy, and quality of a company's reported earnings.

**QofE is not an audit**:
- **Audit**: Confirms that financial statements comply with GAAP and are free from material misstatement
- **QofE**: Assesses whether EBITDA is sustainable, recurring, and accurately reflects the underlying economics of the business

**Why QofE matters**:
1. **Valuation protection**: Ensures you are not overpaying for non-recurring or low-quality earnings
2. **Risk identification**: Surfaces accounting irregularities, aggressive practices, or one-time benefits
3. **IC confidence**: Provides independent validation of management-reported financials
4. **Negotiation leverage**: QofE adjustments often inform purchase price adjustments or escrow provisions

Associates are responsible for:
- Scoping the QofE engagement with the advisor
- Tracking progress and interim findings
- Reviewing the draft report and flagging key findings for the VP
- Integrating QofE adjustments into the financial model
- Preparing summary materials for IC

### Standard QofE Scope and Deliverables

**Typical QofE scope**:

1. **Normalized EBITDA calculation**: Adjusting reported EBITDA for non-recurring, non-operating, or non-cash items

2. **Revenue quality analysis**: Assessing revenue recognition policies, customer concentration, seasonality, and sustainability

3. **Cost structure review**: Analyzing COGS and OpEx for unusual items, related-party transactions, or owner benefits

4. **Working capital analysis**: Calculating normalized working capital levels and identifying volatility drivers

5. **Net debt calculation**: Confirming cash, debt, and debt-like items for funds flow purposes

6. **Management interviews**: Discussing findings and clarifying accounting treatments

**Deliverables**:
- **Interim findings memo** (typically 2–3 weeks into engagement)
- **Draft QofE report** (typically 4–5 weeks in)
- **Final QofE report** (post-management review and comment incorporation)

**Timeline**: Full QofE typically takes 4–6 weeks from kickoff to final report, depending on complexity and data availability.

### EBITDA Normalization Adjustments: What to Focus On

QofE reports often include dozens of adjustments. Not all are equally important.

**Categories of adjustments**:

**1. Add-backs (increase EBITDA)**

Expenses that are non-recurring, non-operating, or will not continue post-close:

- **Owner compensation adjustments**: If owner/CEO is paid $500K but market comp for a professional CEO is $250K, add back $250K
- **One-time expenses**: Legal fees for a one-time litigation, restructuring costs, transaction bonuses
- **Non-operating expenses**: Costs related to non-core assets or discontinued operations
- **Personal expenses**: Owner's personal travel, family members on payroll who do not work in the business

**Credibility test**: Would a third-party professional manager incur this expense? If yes, it should not be added back.

**2. Deductions (decrease EBITDA)**

Items that inflate reported EBITDA but are not sustainable:

- **Pull-forward revenue**: Revenue recognized early (e.g., annual subscription billed and recognized upfront)
- **Deferred expenses**: Maintenance, marketing, or IT spend that was delayed or deferred to inflate current-period EBITDA
- **Under-market compensation**: If key employees are paid below market and will require raises post-close
- **Aggressive capitalization**: Expenses that should have been expensed but were capitalized

**Credibility test**: Is this level of performance sustainable going forward? If not, it should be deducted.

**3. Timing or classification adjustments (neutral or minor impact)**

Reclassifications that do not change the underlying economics but clarify presentation:

- **Reclassifying R&D from COGS to OpEx** (no EBITDA impact, but affects gross margin)
- **Correcting misclassified accounts**

**What to focus on**:

Prioritize adjustments that are:
- **Material** (>5% of EBITDA)
- **Directional** (multiple deductions suggest systemic risk)
- **Controversial** (management is likely to dispute them)

### Red Flags in QofE Findings

**Red Flag 1: Aggressive revenue recognition**

- Revenue recognized before delivery or acceptance by customer
- Gross vs. net revenue reporting issues (e.g., reporting partner fees as revenue)
- Bill-and-hold arrangements that may not meet recognition criteria

**Escalation**: If revenue recognition is aggressive, this is a credibility issue. Escalate to VP immediately and assess whether the issue is isolated or systemic.

**Red Flag 2: Excessive or questionable add-backs**

- Management attempts to add back expenses that are clearly recurring (e.g., "marketing is discretionary, so we add it back")
- Add-backs exceed 20–30% of reported EBITDA without clear justification
- Related-party transactions (owner's entity charges consulting fees to the business)

**Escalation**: If add-backs are questionable, push back with the QofE advisor. Request that they flag these as "non-standard" in the report.

**Red Flag 3: Working capital volatility or manipulation**

- Working capital balances vary wildly quarter-to-quarter with no operational explanation
- Vendor payments delayed pre-close to inflate cash
- Customer prepayments pulled forward to boost cash position

**Escalation**: Working capital manipulation can lead to post-close cash shortfalls. Ensure working capital peg is set appropriately in the SPA.

**Red Flag 4: Undisclosed liabilities or off-balance-sheet items**

- Leases or commitments not reflected in financials
- Contingent liabilities (warranties, indemnities) not accrued

**Escalation**: Undisclosed liabilities are a material issue. Escalate to VP and legal counsel. May require escrow or indemnity protection.

**Red Flag 5: Management disputes all adjustments**

- Management disagrees with every QofE finding and provides weak justifications
- Seller pressures you to "disregard the QofE"

**Escalation**: If management is combative about QofE findings, this is a credibility and transparency red flag. Escalate to VP and principal.

### Scoping the QofE Engagement: Associate Responsibilities

Associates typically lead the QofE scoping process in coordination with the VP.

**Scoping kickoff call agenda**:

1. **Transaction overview**: Deal rationale, key risks, timeline
2. **Financial data availability**: What financials exist (audited, reviewed, compiled)? Monthly detail? Segment breakouts?
3. **Specific focus areas**: Based on diligence to date, what should QofE prioritize? (e.g., revenue quality, margin drivers, working capital)
4. **Known issues or questions**: Flag areas of concern upfront (e.g., "We have questions about how revenue is recognized for multi-year contracts")
5. **Timeline and deliverables**: Confirm interim and final report dates
6. **Cost estimate**: Ensure fee is within budget

**Post-kickoff**:
- Facilitate VDR access for QofE team
- Track document requests from QofE advisor
- Schedule management interviews
- Monitor interim findings and escalate issues early

### Interpreting the QofE Report: What to Extract

When the draft QofE report arrives, do not read it linearly from page 1. Focus on high-value sections first.

**Priority 1: Executive summary and normalized EBITDA reconciliation** (pages 1–5)

This shows:
- Reported EBITDA vs. QofE-adjusted EBITDA
- Summary of material adjustments
- Key findings and risks

**Priority 2: Revenue quality section**

Look for:
- Revenue recognition policy assessment
- Customer concentration and retention analysis
- Seasonality or one-time revenue events

**Priority 3: EBITDA normalization detail**

Review each adjustment:
- Do you agree with it?
- Is it material?
- Will management dispute it?
- Does it change your valuation?

**Priority 4: Working capital analysis**

Understand:
- Normalized working capital level
- Volatility drivers
- Implications for funds flow and closing adjustments

**Priority 5: Appendices**

Reference as needed for supporting detail.

### Integrating QofE Findings into the Financial Model

Once you have QofE-adjusted EBITDA, update the model:

**Step 1: Adjust historical EBITDA**

Replace management-reported EBITDA with QofE-adjusted EBITDA for FY21, FY22, FY23.

**Step 2: Assess impact on growth and margin trends**

If QofE adjustments are concentrated in one year, understand why. Does this reflect a one-time event or a trend?

**Step 3: Update forward projections**

If QofE deducted $2M from FY23 EBITDA for deferred maintenance, does that expense recur going forward? If yes, reduce projected EBITDA.

**Step 4: Recalculate valuation**

QofE-adjusted EBITDA × multiple = revised enterprise value. If adjustments are material, this may affect willingness to pay or trigger price renegotiation.

**Step 5: Update working capital peg**

If QofE normalized working capital differs from management's estimate, update the funds flow and closing balance sheet assumptions.

### Managing QofE Disputes with Management

Management will often dispute QofE adjustments, especially deductions. Your job is to facilitate resolution.

**Dispute resolution process**:

1. **Review management's objection**: Is it reasonable? Do they have supporting data?

2. **Consult with QofE advisor**: Share management's response and ask for their perspective. Are they willing to revise the adjustment?

3. **Escalate to VP**: If the dispute is material or unresolved, bring it to your VP. They will decide whether to:
   - Accept management's position
   - Hold firm on QofE adjustment
   - Split the difference
   - Escalate to principal or use as negotiating leverage on price

**Example dispute**:

QofE deducts $1M for "below-market rent" paid to owner's related entity.
Management response: "The rent is market; we have a third-party appraisal."

**Your action**: Request the appraisal. Share with QofE advisor. If appraisal is credible, consider removing the adjustment. If appraisal is weak or biased, hold the adjustment.

**Guiding principle**: QofE adjustments should be defensible with data. If management can credibly refute an adjustment, remove it. If not, hold firm.

### Timing QofE Relative to Deal Milestones

**Ideal timing**:
- **Kickoff**: Shortly after LOI signing
- **Interim findings**: 2–3 weeks in (before internal check-in memo)
- **Draft report**: 4–5 weeks in (in time for IC prep)
- **Final report**: Before IC (ideally 1 week before to allow time for review)

**If QofE is delayed**:
- Escalate to VP immediately
- Assess whether IC can proceed with interim findings or must be postponed
- Apply pressure to QofE advisor to expedite (while maintaining quality)

**If QofE is not complete before IC**:
- Flag this explicitly in the IC memo
- Present preliminary findings with caveats
- Explain the timeline for final report
- IC may approve subject to final QofE confirming preliminary findings
