# Structuring the Deal Thesis

## Learning Objectives

- Explain the components of a compelling PE investment thesis and how it differs from generic strategic rationale
- Evaluate whether a thesis is specific and actionable versus vague and aspirational
- Develop frameworks for articulating why this deal is attractive now and why your firm is positioned to win
- Diagnose when a thesis relies on market beta versus alpha creation and adjust framing accordingly
- Structure thesis statements that are memorable, defensible, and link directly to value creation initiatives
- Defend thesis choices when IC challenges differentiation, timing, or execution feasibility

## Written Guide

### What is an Investment Thesis

An investment thesis is a concise, specific statement of why a deal is attractive and how value will be created.

**Good thesis example**:
"Acquire a founder-owned B2B SaaS company with best-in-class retention (NRR 120%) that is under-monetized due to stagnant pricing. Expand EBITDA margin from 18% to 28% through pricing optimization (70% of value creation) and sales efficiency improvements (30% of value creation). Exit at 12× EBITDA (current market multiple) to generate 3.2× MOIC in 4 years."

**Bad thesis example**:
"Invest in a high-quality SaaS business in a growing market with strong management and significant growth potential."

**Why the good thesis works**:
- Specific: Identifies the exact value creation levers (pricing, sales efficiency)
- Quantified: States entry margin (18%), target margin (28%), value creation attribution
- Defensible: Based on comparable market multiples and specific operational improvements
- Actionable: Clear initiatives (pricing optimization, sales efficiency)

**Why the bad thesis fails**:
- Vague: "High-quality," "growing market," "significant potential" are meaningless
- No value creation plan
- No differentiation: Any firm could make this claim

### Core Components of a Thesis

**1. The opportunity (why now)**

What makes this investment timely?
- Market inflection point
- Founder liquidity event
- Business at scale but under-managed
- Competitive dynamics creating opening

**2. The edge (why us)**

Why is your firm positioned to win?
- Sector expertise
- Operating partner capabilities
- Proprietary deal source
- Differentiated value creation playbook

**3. The value creation plan (how we win)**

Specific, prioritized initiatives:
- Revenue growth (organic, M&A, geographic expansion)
- Margin expansion (pricing, procurement, operational efficiency)
- Multiple expansion (repositioning, professionalization)

Quantified contribution of each lever to returns

**4. The exit (how we realize value)**

- Strategic buyer rationale
- Financial buyer comp multiples
- IPO potential (if applicable)

### Thesis Clarity Test

**Can you state the thesis in two sentences?**

If not, it is not clear enough.

**Example**:
"Acquire a regional HVAC service provider with 60% EBITDA coming from recurring maintenance contracts. Grow through tuck-in M&A (6–8 acquisitions over 3 years) to achieve regional density and pricing power, expanding EBITDA from $8M to $25M. Exit to strategic buyer at 10× EBITDA for 3.0× MOIC."

**Two sentences. Clear. Actionable.**

### Avoiding Common Thesis Pitfalls

**Pitfall 1: Thesis is a description, not a plan**

Bad: "XYZ is a leading provider of cloud infrastructure services."
Good: "Acquire XYZ and consolidate fragmented customer contracts onto a unified platform, improving retention from 85% to 92% and expanding margins by 400 bps."

**Pitfall 2: Thesis depends on market growth, not value creation**

Bad: "The market is growing at 15%, so we will grow at 15%."
Good: "We will outgrow the market (15% company growth vs. 8% market growth) by gaining share through superior product and customer success investment."

**Pitfall 3: Thesis has too many levers**

Bad: "We will improve pricing, reduce costs, expand geographically, launch new products, upgrade technology, and pursue M&A."
Good: "Primary value creation is pricing (60% of EBITDA growth) and tuck-in M&A (40%). Other initiatives are secondary."

### Linking Thesis to Diligence Findings

The thesis must be supported by diligence.

**Thesis**: "Expand margins through procurement optimization."

**Diligence validation**:
- QofE shows COGS is 55% of revenue vs. comp average of 48%
- Vendor contracts are fragmented; top 10 suppliers represent 60% of spend with no volume discounts
- Market study shows industry leaders achieve 300–500 bps better margins through centralized procurement
- Comparable portfolio company achieved 400 bps margin improvement in 18 months using similar approach

**If diligence does not support the thesis, the thesis must change.**

**Outline**:
- What is an investment thesis and what makes it compelling (0:00–4:00)
- Core components: Opportunity, edge, value creation, exit (4:00–12:00)
- Thesis clarity test: Two-sentence test (12:00–15:00)
- Common thesis pitfalls and how to avoid them (15:00–20:00)
- Linking thesis to diligence findings (20:00–25:00)

**Suggested Length**: 25 minutes

## Key Takeaways

- A compelling thesis is specific, quantified, defensible, and actionable—it explains why this deal is attractive now, why your firm can win, and how value will be created
- Core components include the opportunity (why now), edge (why us), value creation plan (how we win with quantified levers), and exit strategy (how we realize value)
- Pass the two-sentence clarity test: If you cannot state the thesis concisely, it is not clear enough for IC or execution
- Avoid pitfalls including descriptive statements without plans, reliance on market beta without alpha creation, and too many value creation levers without prioritization
- Link the thesis directly to diligence findings—every value creation claim must be supported by QofE, market study, customer data, or operational benchmarks
- If diligence contradicts the thesis, revise the thesis or pass on the deal—do not force-fit a thesis to justify a desired investment
