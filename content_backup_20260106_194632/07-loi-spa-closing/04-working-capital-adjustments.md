# Working Capital Adjustments

## Learning Objectives

- Explain how working capital adjustments ensure the business is delivered with appropriate operating capital at closing
- Evaluate the components of working capital (AR, inventory, AP, accrued expenses) and calculate normalized levels
- Develop frameworks for negotiating working capital pegs and true-up mechanisms
- Diagnose seller manipulation tactics including accelerated collections or deferred vendor payments
- Structure working capital calculations and review processes that prevent post-close disputes
- Defend working capital positions when sellers challenge normalized levels or adjustment calculations

## Written Guide

### Why Working Capital Adjustments Matter

**Working capital** = Current assets - Current liabilities (excluding cash and debt)

Typical components:
- **Current assets**: Accounts receivable (AR), inventory, prepaid expenses
- **Current liabilities**: Accounts payable (AP), accrued expenses, deferred revenue

**Purpose of adjustment**: Ensure buyer receives business with normal operating capital, not artificially inflated or depleted levels.

**Example of manipulation**:

Seller accelerates collections pre-close (AR declines below normal). Buyer receives less working capital than needed to operate. Post-close, buyer must inject cash.

**Protection**: Working capital true-up adjusts purchase price dollar-for-dollar.

### Setting the Working Capital Peg

**Peg** = target level of working capital at closing

**How it is determined**:
1. Calculate historical average working capital over trailing 12–24 months
2. Adjust for seasonality
3. Agree on peg in SPA

**Example calculation**:

| Month | AR | Inventory | AP | Accrued Exp | Working Capital |
|-------|---------|-----------|---------|-------------|------------------|
| Jan | $5.0M | $3.0M | $2.5M | $1.0M | $4.5M |
| Feb | $5.5M | $3.2M | $2.7M | $1.1M | $4.9M |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| Dec | $5.2M | $3.1M | $2.6M | $1.0M | $4.7M |
| **Avg** | **$5.2M** | **$3.0M** | **$2.6M** | **$1.0M** | **$4.6M** |

**Working capital peg**: $4.6M

### Working Capital True-Up Mechanism

**SPA language**:

"If closing working capital is below the peg, seller shall pay buyer the shortfall. If closing working capital exceeds the peg, buyer shall pay seller the excess."

**Example**:

- **Peg**: $4.6M
- **Actual closing WC**: $4.0M
- **Shortfall**: $600K
- **Adjustment**: Buyer receives $600K from escrow or seller pays post-close

**Deadline**: Typically finalized 60–90 days post-close based on closing balance sheet prepared by buyer and reviewed by seller.

### Calculation Disputes and Resolution

**Common disputes**:

**1. What is included in working capital?**

Seller: "Deferred revenue should not be included."
Buyer: "It is a current liability; it must be included."

**Resolution**: Define working capital components explicitly in SPA.

**2. Seller challenges buyer's closing balance sheet**

Seller: "You overstated AR by $200K."
Buyer: "Our calculation follows GAAP."

**Resolution**: SPA includes dispute resolution mechanism (third-party accounting firm arbitration).

**3. Seasonality**

Seller: "You closed in Q4, which is low-inventory season. Use Q4 average, not annual average."
Buyer: "Peg should reflect full year to avoid seasonal timing manipulation."

**Resolution**: If business is highly seasonal, consider month-specific or seasonal peg.

### Protecting Against Working Capital Manipulation

**Seller tactics to inflate working capital pre-close**:
- Delay vendor payments (inflate AP)
- Accelerate billing customers (inflate AR, even if not collectible)
- Reduce inventory (liquidate stock)

**Buyer protections**:
- **Quality of working capital**: Exclude AR >90 days past due or uncollectible receivables
- **Minimum levels**: Set minimum levels for each component (e.g., minimum inventory to maintain operations)
- **Ordinary course covenant**: Seller must operate in ordinary course pre-close (no extraordinary working capital actions)

## Key Takeaways

- Working capital adjustments ensure buyer receives the business with normalized operating capital (AR, inventory, AP, accrued expenses) at closing
- Set the working capital peg by calculating historical average over 12–24 months, adjusting for seasonality, and agreeing in the SPA
- True-up mechanism provides dollar-for-dollar purchase price adjustments if closing working capital differs from the peg—shortfalls reduce proceeds to seller, excess increases proceeds
- Define working capital components explicitly in SPA to avoid disputes about what is included (deferred revenue, prepaid expenses, etc.)
- Protect against seller manipulation (delayed vendor payments, accelerated collections) by excluding uncollectible AR, setting minimum component levels, and requiring ordinary course operations pre-close
- Finalize working capital adjustments 60–90 days post-close based on closing balance sheet with SPA-defined dispute resolution (third-party accounting arbitration if disagreement)
