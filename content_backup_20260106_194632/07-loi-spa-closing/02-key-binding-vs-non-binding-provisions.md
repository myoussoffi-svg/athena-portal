# Key Binding vs Non-Binding Provisions

## Learning Objectives

- Explain which LOI provisions are binding versus non-binding and the legal implications of each
- Evaluate the enforceability of exclusivity, confidentiality, and expense provisions
- Develop frameworks for negotiating binding terms that protect buyer interests without over-committing
- Diagnose when binding provisions may be breached and determine appropriate remedies
- Structure binding provision language that is clear, enforceable, and aligned with deal strategy

## Written Guide

### Binding vs. Non-Binding: Legal Distinction

**Non-binding provisions** (majority of LOI):
- Purchase price
- Deal structure
- Closing conditions
- Timeline

Either party can walk away without legal consequence.

**Binding provisions**:
- Exclusivity (no-shop)
- Confidentiality
- Expense allocation
- Governing law and jurisdiction

Enforceable contracts; breach can result in legal action.

### Exclusivity: The Most Important Binding Provision

**Standard exclusivity clause**:

"For a period of 90 days from the date of this LOI, Seller shall not, and shall cause its representatives not to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate, or encourage any inquiries or proposals from third parties regarding a sale or merger; or (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations with third parties regarding a sale or merger."

**What this means**:
- Seller cannot shop the deal
- Seller cannot respond to inbound inquiries
- Seller's advisors (investment bankers) cannot contact other buyers

**Carve-outs**:
Seller may negotiate exceptions:
- Can respond to unsolicited inquiries (but not negotiate)
- Can terminate exclusivity if buyer does not deliver financing commitment within X days

**Enforcement**:
If seller breaches exclusivity (shops the deal), buyer can:
- Sue for damages (lost diligence costs)
- Seek injunction to block competing transaction
- In practice, litigation is rare; reputational damage to seller/advisor is the real deterrent

### Confidentiality

**Purpose**: Protects sensitive business information disclosed during diligence

**Standard confidentiality clause**:

"Buyer agrees to keep confidential all information received from Seller and use it solely for purposes of evaluating this transaction. Buyer shall not disclose such information to third parties except advisors bound by confidentiality."

**Duration**: Typically survives deal termination for 1–2 years

**Exceptions**:
- Information already public
- Information independently developed by buyer
- Information required to be disclosed by law or regulation

### Expense Allocation

**Standard provision**:

"Each party shall bear its own expenses in connection with this transaction."

**Why this matters**: Diligence costs $200K–$500K. Buyer does not want to reimburse seller if deal fails.

**Seller may request**: "If Buyer terminates, Buyer reimburses Seller for advisor fees up to $X."

**Buyer position**: Resist. Expense reimbursement is rare in middle-market PE.

**Compromise**: Breakup fee only if buyer walks for reasons unrelated to diligence findings (e.g., financing failure, change in fund strategy).

### Non-Solicitation of Employees

Sometimes included as binding provision:

"Buyer agrees not to solicit Seller's employees for [12 months] following termination of this LOI."

**Why sellers request this**: Protects against buyer poaching talent even if deal fails

**Buyer position**: Accept with narrow scope (only applies to senior employees buyer met during diligence, not all employees)

### Governing Law and Jurisdiction

**Standard provision**:

"This LOI shall be governed by the laws of [State]. Any disputes shall be resolved in the courts of [State/City]."

**Why it matters**: Determines which state's laws apply if exclusivity or confidentiality is breached

**Negotiation**: Typically buyer's preferred jurisdiction (where fund is headquartered)

**Outline**:
- Legal distinction: Binding vs. non-binding provisions (0:00–4:00)
- Exclusivity: Scope, enforcement, and carve-outs (4:00–12:00)
- Confidentiality obligations and exceptions (12:00–16:00)
- Expense allocation and breakup fees (16:00–20:00)
- Non-solicitation and governing law provisions (20:00–25:00)

**Suggested Length**: 25 minutes

## Key Takeaways

- Most LOI provisions (price, structure, timeline) are non-binding; key binding provisions are exclusivity, confidentiality, expense allocation, and governing law
- Exclusivity prevents seller from shopping the deal for 60–90 days and is enforceable through litigation or injunction, though reputational damage is the primary deterrent
- Confidentiality protects buyer's access to sensitive business information and survives deal termination for 1–2 years with exceptions for public information or legal requirements
- Expense allocation is typically "each party bears own costs"—resist seller requests for reimbursement unless buyer walks for non-diligence reasons
- Negotiate narrow non-solicitation provisions (senior employees only) and ensure governing law reflects buyer's preferred jurisdiction
- Understand enforcement mechanisms for binding provisions and escalate any potential breaches to your VP and deal counsel immediately
