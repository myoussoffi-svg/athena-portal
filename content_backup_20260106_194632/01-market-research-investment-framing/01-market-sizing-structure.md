# Market Sizing Structure (TAM / SAM / SOM)

## Outcomes
- Build a defensible TAM / SAM / SOM with explicit definitions and a repeatable method.
- Translate sizing into underwriting assumptions and diligence tests (not "slideware").
- Pressure-test the story with sensitivity cases and state what would change your mind.

## Agenda
- Define the market correctly (what is included / excluded).
- Size it three ways (top-down, bottoms-up, triangulation).
- Convert sizing into investment logic (growth, share, pricing, cyclicality).
- Write the memo and identify the next diligence step.

## Why this matters in a real deal
Market sizing is not an academic exercise. It determines whether the growth plan is feasible, whether the "white space" narrative survives diligence, and where IC will pressure-test your assumptions (pricing, penetration, adjacency, cyclicality). Weak sizing leads to weak underwriting: you end up defending a valuation with vibes instead of evidence.

## Deliverable
- Build a 1-2 page market sizing memo with TAM / SAM / SOM, explicit definitions, and a sensitivity table (base / bear / upside).
- State the 3-5 underwriting assumptions that drive SOM and how you will validate each in diligence.
- Write a "so what" conclusion: what the sizing implies for growth, margin, valuation, and go/no-go.

## Checklist
- [ ] Market definitions are explicit and consistent (units, geography, customer type, product scope).
- [ ] You can explain the sizing logic in 60 seconds without hand-waving.
- [ ] At least two independent methods agree within a reasonable band (or you explain why they do not).
- [ ] SOM is tied to a practical go-to-market path (channels, win rates, switching costs), not aspiration.
- [ ] The memo ends with a decision-relevant conclusion and the next diligence action.

## 1) Start with a precise market definition
Write the definition before you size anything. If the definition is wrong, the entire exercise is wrong.

**Define:**
- **Product/service scope:** What is included? What is explicitly excluded?
- **Customer scope:** Who buys? Who influences? Who pays?
- **Geography:** Where does the business compete (today and realistically in 3-5 years)?
- **Unit of measure:** Revenue, volume, installed base, or transactions?

**Rule of thumb:** If you cannot define the market in one sentence, you cannot size it cleanly.

## 2) TAM / SAM / SOM: use them as decision tools
Treat these as "decision scaffolding," not labels.

### TAM (Total Addressable Market)
The total spend (or volume) for the full category under a clear definition.

Use TAM to answer:
- Is the market big enough to support the equity story at the valuation?
- Is there room for multiple winners?
- Is consolidation plausible (fragmentation + scale economics)?

### SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)
The portion of TAM you can realistically serve given:
- channels
- product constraints
- compliance / regulation
- customer segments you can actually win

Use SAM to answer:
- What is the realistic battlefield?
- Where do we compete and where do we not?

### SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)
The realistic share in the SAM you can obtain on the time horizon you underwrite.

Use SOM to answer:
- What must be true for the growth plan to work?
- What is the real path to share (sales motion, switching costs, differentiation)?
- Which assumptions are testable in diligence?

## 3) Size it three ways (and force convergence)
Premium work product uses multiple methods and reconciles them.

### Method A: Top-down (industry sources -> your definition)
1. Start with credible category totals (reports, filings, trade associations).
2. Adjust to match your definition (exclude segments, correct geography).
3. Reconcile contradictions across sources (do not average blindly).

**Common failure mode:** Using a "market size" number that includes things you are not underwriting.

### Method B: Bottoms-up (units x price x adoption)
1. Identify the base of buyers (sites, customers, assets, transactions).
2. Multiply by usage / replacement / purchase frequency.
3. Multiply by an attainable price level.

**Common failure mode:** Inflated assumptions (penetration, frequency, price) that are not anchored in evidence.

### Method C: Triangulation (peer revenue / share / constraints)
Sanity check using:
- competitor revenue and implied share
- channel capacity (salesforce, installers, partners)
- physical constraints (cycle times, labor availability, utilization)

**Common failure mode:** Ignoring operational constraints that cap growth.

## 4) Convert sizing into underwriting logic
Market sizing should change what you underwrite.

### Growth math
If your base-case requires outsized share gains, write that plainly:
- "We require share to increase from X% to Y% in Z years."
Then state what enables it:
- channel expansion, product differentiation, switching costs, pricing power, M&A.

### Pricing power
If the thesis depends on price, isolate it:
- "We require price to increase by X% annually while volume holds."
Then specify validation:
- win/loss data, customer interviews, competitor pricing, churn, renewal uplift.

### Cyclicality and durability
If the market is cyclical, your SOM and timing assumptions change.
Write how you will underwrite through a down cycle.

## 5) What goes into the memo (what a VP expects)
Keep it crisp. This is an internal work product.

**Memo structure (1-2 pages):**
- Market definition (one sentence + bullets for scope)
- TAM / SAM / SOM summary (table)
- Methods used (top-down, bottoms-up, triangulation) with key assumptions
- Sensitivity table (base / bear / upside) with the 2-3 drivers that matter
- Decision implications ("so what") + next diligence step

---

## Synthesis
- If TAM is 2-3x smaller than management implies, what changes in underwriting (growth, valuation, exit)?
- What must be true for share gains to be realistic (channels, win rates, switching costs)?
- What is the single highest-leverage diligence action to validate the sizing (request, expert call, customer reference)?
