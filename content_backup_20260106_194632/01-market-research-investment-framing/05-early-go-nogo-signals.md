# Early Go / No-Go Signals

## Learning Objectives

- Identify deal-breaking risks and red flags early in diligence
- Evaluate whether early findings justify continued investment of time and resources
- Frame go/no-go decisions for senior team and IC
- Balance incomplete information with the need to make timely decisions

## Written Guide

### Why Early Go/No-Go Matters

- Time and resource constraints in competitive processes
- Cost of continuing diligence on unviable deals
- Opportunity cost of missing other deals

### Categories of Deal-Breaking Signals

- Market: structural decline, overcapacity, regulatory risk
- Competition: irrational pricing, new entrants, commoditization
- Company: customer concentration, margin erosion, management red flags
- Financial: working capital drain, hidden liabilities, EBITDA quality issues

### Distinguishing Red Flags from Manageable Risks

- Red flags: fundamental issues that undermine the thesis
- Manageable risks: issues that can be mitigated or priced
- Gray areas: unknowns that require deeper diligence to resolve

### Gathering Evidence for Go/No-Go Decisions

- What level of evidence is sufficient to pass or kill a deal?
- Triangulating data points to confirm or refute concerns
- When to seek additional perspectives (experts, customers, advisors)

### Framing the Go/No-Go Decision

- Presenting findings objectively to senior team
- Separating facts from opinions and assumptions
- Recommending next steps: continue, pivot scope, or pass

### Common Mistakes in Go/No-Go Decisions

- Continuing diligence on deals with clear red flags (sunk cost fallacy)
- Passing too quickly on deals with manageable risks
- Failing to escalate early concerns to senior team
- Not documenting rationale for go/no-go decisions
