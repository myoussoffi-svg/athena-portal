# Tying Diligence Findings to Strategy

## Learning Objectives

- Explain how to connect quantitative diligence findings (revenue trends, margins, churn, KPIs) to management's articulated strategy and assess alignment or disconnect
- Evaluate whether management's strategic priorities address identified risks or whether they are focused on the wrong areas
- Develop frameworks for testing whether strategic initiatives are backed by operational plans, resources, and accountability
- Diagnose when strategy is aspirational (vision without execution roadmap) versus operational (clear initiatives with milestones)
- Structure questions that probe the feasibility and credibility of strategic plans without appearing adversarial
- Defend conclusions about strategic alignment or misalignment when contributing to IC risk assessments
- Identify when strategic pivots or changes in management narrative suggest uncertainty or lack of conviction

## Written Guide

### Why Strategy-Diligence Alignment Matters

Management will present a compelling strategic vision: expand into new markets, launch new products, improve margins, scale the platform. Your job is to assess whether this strategy is:
1. **Grounded in reality**: Supported by data, resources, and operational capacity
2. **Aligned with diligence findings**: Addresses the risks and opportunities you have identified
3. **Executable**: Has clear ownership, timelines, and accountability

A strategy that sounds good in a presentation but lacks operational grounding creates value destruction risk post-close. Conversely, a realistic strategy that acknowledges challenges and includes credible plans to address them builds IC confidence.

Associates must connect the dots between what management says they will do (strategy) and what the data shows they can do (diligence findings). This synthesis directly informs the IC memo's risk and value creation sections.

### Testing Strategic Priorities Against Diligence Findings

**Framework: Strategy-Diligence Reconciliation Matrix**

For each strategic priority management articulates, ask:
1. **Does diligence support this is achievable?**
2. **Does this priority address a known risk or gap?**
3. **Is this the highest-impact area to focus on?**

**Example 1: Strategic Priority = "Expand into new geographies"**

**Diligence findings**:
- Current sales team is at capacity (utilization >90%)
- Historical geographic expansion (last 3 years) showed 18-month ramp to profitability
- Marketing spend in new geographies has not been budgeted

**Assessment**: Strategy is aspirational but under-resourced. Questions to probe:
- "What is the timeline for geographic expansion, and what hiring is required to support it?"
- "What is the expected investment period before new geographies become profitable?"
- "How will you fund this expansion without compressing margins in the core business?"

**Conclusion for IC**: Geographic expansion is a stated priority but lacks operational planning. Execution risk is high unless management commits to hiring and investment plan.

**Example 2: Strategic Priority = "Improve customer retention"**

**Diligence findings**:
- Churn has increased from 8% to 12% over past 18 months
- Customer success team has not scaled with customer base (1 CSM per 50 customers, vs. industry standard of 1 per 30)
- NPS declined from 55 to 45

**Assessment**: Strategy is aligned with a known risk. Questions to probe:
- "What specific initiatives are planned to reduce churn? What is the expected impact?"
- "What investment in customer success is budgeted for the next 12 months?"
- "How are you diagnosing root causes of churn—product issues, pricing, competitive pressure?"

**Conclusion for IC**: Management has correctly identified retention as a priority. Credibility depends on whether they have a concrete action plan with resources allocated.

**Example 3: Strategic Priority = "Launch new product line"**

**Diligence findings**:
- R&D spend has been flat at 8% of revenue for 3 years
- Product roadmap shows 5 initiatives in flight, all behind schedule
- No additional engineering hires planned

**Assessment**: Strategy is not supported by capacity or investment. Questions to probe:
- "What is the timeline for new product launch? What milestones have been achieved to date?"
- "How many engineers are allocated to this initiative vs. existing product maintenance?"
- "What is the expected cannibalization of existing products?"

**Conclusion for IC**: New product launch is a strategic priority but appears under-resourced and delayed. Risk that it distracts from core business without delivering incremental value.

### Identifying Strategic Blind Spots

Sometimes management's strategy ignores the most critical issues revealed in diligence. This is a red flag.

**Blind spot pattern 1: Management focuses on growth; diligence reveals profitability risk**

Management says: "We are focused on scaling revenue to $200M in 3 years."
Diligence shows: Gross margin has compressed 500 bps; EBITDA margin is declining.

**Probe**: "We see revenue growth has been strong, but margins have compressed significantly. How are you balancing growth with profitability? What specific actions are planned to stabilize or expand margins?"

**Blind spot pattern 2: Management focuses on product; diligence reveals go-to-market execution issues**

Management says: "Our product is superior to competitors, and we are investing heavily in R&D."
Diligence shows: Sales productivity has declined; CAC has doubled; quota attainment is <60%.

**Probe**: "The product differentiation is clear. However, sales efficiency has deteriorated. How are you addressing sales execution and productivity?"

**Blind spot pattern 3: Management focuses on top-line; diligence reveals customer retention crisis**

Management says: "We added 200 new customers last year."
Diligence shows: Churned 180 customers in the same period; net adds were only 20.

**Probe**: "New customer acquisition looks strong, but churn has also increased. What is your net customer retention, and how are you addressing churn?"

**Why blind spots matter**: If management is not focused on the right problems, they will not solve them post-close. This increases execution risk and reduces the likelihood of achieving value creation plans.

### Assessing Operational Grounding: Vision vs. Execution Roadmap

**Aspirational strategy** (red flag):
- Vague language ("we plan to," "we believe we can," "we intend to")
- No timelines, milestones, or KPIs
- No assigned ownership or accountability
- No budget or resource allocation

**Example**:
"We plan to improve sales efficiency by leveraging data and analytics."

**Operational strategy** (positive signal):
- Specific initiatives with clear scope
- Defined timelines and success metrics
- Named owners and resources allocated
- Contingency plans or risk mitigation

**Example**:
"We are implementing a new CRM system (Salesforce) by Q2 to improve pipeline visibility. The VP of Sales is leading the rollout with support from a dedicated project manager. We expect this to reduce sales cycle length by 15% within 6 months, based on benchmarks from similar implementations. We have budgeted $200K for the implementation and training."

**How to probe for operational grounding**:

| Management Statement | Probe for Operational Detail |
|----------------------|------------------------------|
| "We will expand gross margin" | "What specific cost reduction initiatives are planned? Who owns each initiative? What is the expected margin impact of each?" |
| "We will improve customer retention" | "What is the root cause of current churn? What customer success investments are planned? What is the expected churn reduction and timeline?" |
| "We will hire aggressively to support growth" | "What roles are you hiring for? What is the time-to-productivity for each role? What is the capacity of your current recruiting infrastructure?" |
| "We will invest in technology" | "What specific technology investments? What is the expected ROI? What is the implementation timeline?" |

If management cannot provide operational detail, the strategy is likely aspirational rather than executable.

### Testing Resource Allocation: Is Strategy Funded?

Strategy requires resources: capital, people, time. If management articulates a strategy but has not allocated resources, it is not a real priority.

**Resource allocation checklist**:

1. **Budget**: Is there a line item in the financial plan for this initiative? How much is allocated?
2. **Headcount**: Does the strategy require hiring? How many people? What roles? What is the hiring timeline?
3. **Management time**: Who is accountable for executing this strategy? What percentage of their time is allocated to it?
4. **External resources**: Does the strategy require consultants, technology vendors, or other third parties? Are they already engaged or budgeted?

**Example testing**:

Management says: "Customer retention is our top priority."

**Test**:
- "How much are you investing in customer success this year? What is the headcount increase?"
- Management responds: "We have not budgeted incremental spend. We plan to reprioritize existing resources."

**Interpretation**: Retention is a stated priority but not funded. Likely to remain a problem post-close.

Contrast with:

Management says: "Customer retention is our top priority. We are hiring 5 customer success managers this year at a cost of $500K. We are also implementing a new customer health monitoring tool (Gainsight) for $100K. The VP of Customer Success is leading this initiative and will report quarterly retention metrics to the board."

**Interpretation**: Retention is a funded, operationalized priority. Higher credibility.

### Recognizing Strategic Pivots and Narrative Changes

If management's strategy today differs significantly from the strategy articulated in the CIM or earlier conversations, probe why.

**Scenario 1: Pivot reflects learning**

CIM said: "We are focused on SMB market."
Management now says: "We have learned that enterprise customers have better unit economics and retention. We are pivoting to focus on enterprise."

**Probe**: "When did this pivot occur? What drove the decision? How far along are you in executing the pivot? What is the impact on existing SMB customers?"

**Assessment**: Pivots based on data and learning can be positive if well-executed. Assess whether the pivot is early-stage (high risk) or advanced (lower risk).

**Scenario 2: Pivot reflects lack of conviction**

CIM said: "We will expand into Europe."
Management now says: "Europe is on hold. We are focused on North America."

**Probe**: "What changed? Was there a specific issue or challenge that led to the decision to pause Europe expansion?"

**Assessment**: Abandoning a strategic initiative suggests either poor initial planning or external challenges. Understand the root cause and whether it reflects broader execution risk.

**Scenario 3: Narrative spin without substance**

CIM said: "We are a high-growth SaaS company."
Diligence shows: Growth has slowed to 5%; churn is increasing.
Management now says: "We are focused on profitability and sustainable growth, not growth at all costs."

**Assessment**: This is narrative spin to reframe underperformance. Probe whether there is a credible profitability improvement plan or whether this is just repositioning.

### Linking Strategy to Value Creation Plans

The strategy management articulates should inform your firm's value creation plan. As you listen to management, think:
- **Which of their priorities align with our value creation thesis?**
- **Which of their priorities are wrong or low-impact, and where would we redirect focus?**
- **What capabilities or resources would we need to add post-close to execute the strategy?**

**Example**:

Management's strategy: "Expand product portfolio and enter adjacent markets."

Your firm's value creation thesis: "Improve retention and pricing in core market; avoid distractions."

**Implication**: Misalignment between management's priorities and your value creation plan. This will require post-close management of expectations, potential executive changes, or re-scoping of strategy.

Flag this misalignment in your IC memo as a cultural or strategic risk.

## Key Takeaways

- Test whether management's strategic priorities are supported by diligence findings, address known risks, and represent the highest-impact areas to focus on
- Identify strategic blind spots where management ignores critical issues (e.g., focusing on growth while margins compress, or product while GTM execution fails)
- Distinguish between aspirational strategy (vague, no timelines, no resources) and operational strategy (specific initiatives, owners, budgets, milestones)
- Test resource allocation by asking whether initiatives are funded with budget, headcount, management time, and external resources—unfunded priorities are not real
- Probe strategic pivots or narrative changes to understand whether they reflect data-driven learning or lack of conviction and execution discipline
- Link management's strategy to your firm's value creation plan and flag misalignments as cultural or strategic risks that require post-close management
- Escalate to your VP when strategy is misaligned with diligence reality, under-resourced, or reflects blind spots that threaten value creation
