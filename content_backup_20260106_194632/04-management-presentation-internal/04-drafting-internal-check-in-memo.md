# Drafting the Internal Check-In Memo

## Learning Objectives

- Explain the purpose and structure of an internal check-in memo as a decision gate for continuing or pausing diligence
- Evaluate which findings are decision-critical versus supporting detail and prioritize them in the memo structure
- Develop frameworks for synthesizing diligence status, management assessment, and key risks into a concise, actionable format
- Diagnose when the memo should recommend proceeding, pausing for additional work, restructuring the deal, or passing entirely
- Structure clear go/no-go recommendations with supporting rationale that enables principals and partners to make informed decisions
- Defend memo conclusions when challenged by VPs or principals who may have different interpretations of risk or opportunity
- Identify gaps in analysis or outstanding questions that must be resolved before IC and incorporate them explicitly into the memo

## Written Guide

### What is the Internal Check-In Memo and Why It Matters

The internal check-in memo is a mid-diligence checkpoint document prepared by the deal team (typically drafted by the associate, refined by the VP) and circulated to the principal and/or partner.

**Purpose**:
1. **Status update**: Summarize what has been learned to date
2. **Risk assessment**: Highlight key risks and concerns identified during diligence
3. **Decision gate**: Recommend whether to continue, pause, restructure, or pass
4. **Resource allocation**: Inform whether to commit additional time, third-party spend, or internal bandwidth

**Timing**:
The check-in memo is typically drafted after:
- Initial VDR review is complete (~50–70% of DRL items received)
- First or second management presentation has occurred
- Early third-party diligence findings are available (e.g., preliminary QofE, market study)

This is usually 3–4 weeks into diligence, roughly halfway between IOI and LOI (or between LOI and IC if the memo is post-LOI).

**Why it matters**:
Diligence is expensive (consultant fees, travel, internal time). The check-in memo ensures the firm does not over-invest in deals that are unlikely to proceed. It also surfaces issues early enough to address them before IC, rather than discovering them days before the investment decision.

Associates who draft clear, actionable check-in memos demonstrate strategic judgment and save their VPs time. Those who produce vague or incomplete memos force VPs to do the synthesis themselves.

### Standard Check-In Memo Structure

A check-in memo should be **3–5 pages** (plus appendices if needed). Conciseness is critical; principals and partners will skim, not read deeply.

**Recommended structure**:

**1. Executive Summary (0.5–1 page)**
- **Current status**: Where we are in diligence (% of DRL complete, management sessions held, third-party work in progress)
- **Headline findings**: 3–5 bullet points summarizing what we have learned
- **Key risks**: 2–3 top risks identified
- **Recommendation**: Proceed / Proceed with conditions / Restructure / Pause / Pass

**2. Diligence Status (0.5 page)**
- **Completed**: VDR review, management presentations, third-party workstreams finished
- **In progress**: Outstanding DRL items, third-party reports expected dates
- **Not yet started**: Any planned workstreams deferred pending check-in outcome

**3. Thesis Validation (0.5–1 page)**
- **Investment thesis recap** (1–2 sentences)
- **What supports the thesis**: Evidence from diligence that validates the thesis
- **What challenges the thesis**: Evidence that contradicts or complicates the thesis
- **Net assessment**: Is the thesis still intact, modified, or invalidated?

**4. Key Findings by Workstream (1–2 pages)**

Break down by functional area:

**Commercial**:
- Revenue composition, growth trends, customer concentration
- Retention and churn dynamics
- Sales efficiency and pipeline health

**Financial**:
- Margin trends and drivers
- Working capital and cash conversion
- Quality of earnings findings (if available)

**Operational**:
- KPIs and operational efficiency
- Capacity and scalability
- Technology and product roadmap

**Organizational**:
- Management quality and bench strength
- Turnover and retention risk
- Key person dependencies

For each area, include:
- **Finding** (what did we learn?)
- **Implication** (what does it mean for the deal?)
- **Outstanding questions** (what remains unresolved?)

**5. Risk Summary (0.5–1 page)**

| Risk | Severity | Mitigant | Status |
|------|----------|----------|--------|
| Customer concentration: Top customer is 30% of revenue with contract expiring in 6 months | High | Proactive renewal discussions underway; management reports strong relationship | Monitoring |
| Gross margin compression: 300 bps decline over 2 years | Medium | Root cause analysis in progress; appears to be mix shift, not cost inflation | Under investigation |
| VP of Sales departed 3 months ago; role still vacant | Medium | Interim CRO is managing sales team; search underway | Retention risk if search drags |

**6. Recommendation and Next Steps (0.5 page)**

**Clear recommendation**:
- **Proceed**: Diligence supports continuing to IC. No major red flags. Outstanding items are manageable.
- **Proceed with conditions**: Diligence supports proceeding, but specific items must be resolved (e.g., customer renewal confirmed, QofE finalized).
- **Restructure**: Deal is viable but at a lower valuation or with different structure (e.g., earnout, escrow, reduced equity check).
- **Pause**: Significant open questions require additional work before committing further resources.
- **Pass**: Fundamental issues identified that make the deal unattractive at any reasonable price.

**Next steps**:
- Outstanding diligence to complete
- Follow-up meetings or calls scheduled
- Third-party reports expected
- Timeline to IC decision

**7. Appendices (optional)**

- Detailed financial tables
- Customer concentration analysis
- Org chart
- Outstanding DRL tracker

### Writing Style: Direct and Concise

The check-in memo is an internal document. Unlike customer-facing materials, it should be direct, honest, and free of spin.

**Good style**:
- "Churn has increased from 8% to 12% over the past 18 months. Root cause is unclear but appears related to competitive pressure in the SMB segment. Management has not implemented a formal retention program."

**Bad style**:
- "Churn dynamics present a nuanced challenge that may require further exploration to fully understand the drivers and potential mitigants, although management has expressed confidence in their ability to address this over time."

**Why good style wins**: It communicates the issue clearly and allows the reader to make a decision. Bad style obscures the issue and forces the reader to guess at the severity.

### Thesis Validation: Honest Assessment

The thesis validation section is critical. Do not sugarcoat.

**If the thesis is intact**:
"Diligence confirms that the business has strong retention (NRR of 115%) and is under-monetizing its customer base. Margin expansion opportunity through pricing and upsell is credible. Thesis remains intact."

**If the thesis is challenged**:
"Diligence reveals that churn is higher than initially understood (12% vs. assumed 5%). While upsell opportunity exists, it is offset by higher-than-expected customer losses. Thesis is challenged but may still be viable if retention can be stabilized."

**If the thesis is invalidated**:
"Diligence shows that gross margin has compressed 500 bps due to competitive pricing pressure. Management has no credible plan to reverse this trend. The margin expansion thesis is invalidated. Recommend passing unless valuation is materially reduced."

Principals and partners rely on this section to decide whether to continue investing time. If you hedge or avoid difficult conclusions, you undermine the memo's value.

### Risk Categorization: High / Medium / Low

Not all risks are equal. Categorize them clearly.

**High severity**:
- Deal-breaking if unresolved
- Material impact on valuation or returns
- Requires immediate escalation or mitigation

Examples:
- Key customer at risk of churn
- Material litigation with uncertain outcome
- Management credibility concerns

**Medium severity**:
- Manageable but requires attention
- May affect valuation or structure
- Can be mitigated post-close

Examples:
- Employee turnover above industry average
- Technology debt requiring investment
- Operational inefficiencies that represent value creation opportunities

**Low severity**:
- Minor issues that do not affect investment decision
- Can be addressed post-close without urgency

Examples:
- Office lease renewal in 18 months
- Minor compliance gaps in non-material areas

**Why categorization matters**: Principals need to know where to focus. If everything is flagged as high risk, nothing is. If material risks are buried in low-risk buckets, they may be missed.

### Recommendations: Proceed, Restructure, or Pass

Your recommendation must be clear and supported by rationale.

**Recommend "Proceed" when**:
- Thesis is intact or stronger than initially believed
- Risks are identified but manageable or mitigable
- Outstanding items are minor and do not block IC
- Management is credible and capable

**Recommend "Proceed with Conditions" when**:
- Thesis is intact but specific items must be confirmed (e.g., customer renewal, QofE adjustments)
- Risks are manageable if certain mitigants are implemented (e.g., retention bonuses for key employees)
- Valuation or structure may need adjustment pending final data

**Recommend "Restructure" when**:
- Thesis is challenged but deal is viable at lower valuation
- Risks are elevated and require structural protection (earnout, escrow, indemnities)
- Management or operational gaps require post-close investment that was not budgeted

**Recommend "Pause" when**:
- Critical information is missing and cannot proceed to IC without it
- Third-party diligence is delayed or incomplete
- Significant unresolved questions require additional management engagement

**Recommend "Pass" when**:
- Thesis is invalidated
- Risks are unmitigable and deal-breaking
- Management credibility is compromised
- Valuation required to make the deal work is unrealistic

**Example recommendation (Proceed with Conditions)**:

"We recommend proceeding to IC subject to confirmation of the following:
1. Customer A (30% of revenue) renews contract on terms consistent with prior periods. Renewal discussions are underway; confirmation expected by [date].
2. QofE is finalized and confirms no material adjustments to EBITDA beyond the $500K identified in preliminary findings.
3. VP of Sales search is completed and a credible candidate is identified prior to close.

Assuming these conditions are met, the deal supports our thesis and is attractive at the current valuation."

### Common Mistakes in Check-In Memos

**Mistake 1: Too long (8+ pages)**
Principals will not read it. Distill to essentials.

**Mistake 2: No clear recommendation**
If the reader finishes the memo and does not know whether you are recommending proceed or pass, the memo has failed.

**Mistake 3: Burying the lede**
The most important finding should be in the executive summary, not on page 4.

**Mistake 4: Hedging or ambiguity**
Phrases like "it is possible that" or "we may want to consider" are weak. Be direct.

**Mistake 5: Failing to quantify risks**
Saying "customer concentration is a concern" is not actionable. Saying "top customer is 30% of revenue; if they churn, EBITDA declines $5M" is actionable.

**Mistake 6: Ignoring outstanding work**
If critical diligence is incomplete, flag it explicitly. Do not imply everything is resolved when it is not.

### Collaborating with Your VP on the Memo

The associate typically drafts the check-in memo, but the VP will review and edit before it goes to the principal.

**Best practices for collaboration**:

1. **Share a rough draft early**: Send an outline or bullet points to your VP before writing the full memo. This ensures alignment on structure and key messages.

2. **Highlight areas where you need input**: If you are uncertain whether a risk is high or medium severity, flag it for discussion.

3. **Be open to edits**: Your VP has more context on firm priorities, principal preferences, and deal dynamics. Do not be defensive about edits.

4. **Incorporate feedback quickly**: If your VP requests revisions, turn them around within hours, not days.

5. **Proofread**: Typos, formatting errors, or inconsistent data undermine credibility. Check everything before submitting.
