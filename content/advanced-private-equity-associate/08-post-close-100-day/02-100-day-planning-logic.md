# 100 Day Planning Logic

## Outcomes
- Build a work product you could share internally.
- Identify the decisions and risks this work supports.
- Execute a repeatable workflow under time pressure.

## Agenda
- Define the objective and decision context.
- Gather the minimum inputs needed.
- Analyze and pressure-test assumptions.
- Translate findings into implications and next steps.

## Why this matters in a real deal
This work determines whether the deal narrative survives scrutiny. Done well, it improves decision quality and surfaces risk early. Done poorly, it creates false confidence and wastes diligence time.

## Deliverable
- Produce a 1–2 page output (memo, outline, or analysis) that is decision-relevant and defensible.

## Checklist
- [ ] Scope and definitions are explicit.
- [ ] Key assumptions are stated and testable.
- [ ] Downside risks are identified and prioritized.
- [ ] Findings translate into underwriting implications.
- [ ] Next diligence actions are clear.
## Learning Objectives

- Explain the purpose and structure of a 100-day plan as a framework for post-close value creation priorities
- Evaluate which initiatives belong in the 100-day plan versus longer-term strategic roadmaps
- Develop frameworks for prioritizing quick wins, operational stabilization, and foundational improvements
- Diagnose when 100-day plans are too ambitious or too conservative and recalibrate scope
- Structure 100-day plan documents with clear owners, milestones, and success metrics
- Defend 100-day plan priorities when management resists changes or operating partners propose additional initiatives

## Written Guide

### What is a 100-Day Plan

The 100-day plan is a prioritized list of initiatives to execute in the first 3–4 months post-close.

**Purpose**:
- Stabilize the business (ensure no disruption from ownership change)
- Capture quick wins (initiatives with immediate EBITDA or cash impact)
- Lay foundation for longer-term value creation

**Not a comprehensive value creation plan**: Full value creation typically spans 3–5 years. 100-day plan focuses on immediate priorities.

### Structuring the 100-Day Plan

**1. Stabilization (Weeks 1–4)**

- Retain key employees (deliver retention bonuses, communicate ownership transition)
- Maintain customer relationships (reassure top customers, address concerns)
- Ensure operational continuity (no system disruptions, vendor relationships intact)

**2. Quick Wins (Weeks 4–12)**

- Initiatives with near-term EBITDA impact and low execution risk
- Examples: Pricing increases, discretionary cost cuts, vendor contract renegotiations, working capital improvements

**3. Foundational Improvements (Weeks 8–16)**

- Build infrastructure for longer-term value creation
- Examples: Hire key roles (CFO, VP Sales), implement KPI dashboards, upgrade financial reporting, develop strategic plan

### Prioritization Framework: Impact vs. Effort

**High Impact, Low Effort (Do First)**:
- Pricing increases for underpriced products
- Eliminate unnecessary subscriptions or services
- Renegotiate expiring vendor contracts

**High Impact, High Effort (Do Second)**:
- Hire new C-suite executive
- Implement new ERP system
- Launch M&A search for add-on acquisitions

**Low Impact, Low Effort (Do if Bandwidth Permits)**:
- Office space optimization
- Update marketing collateral

**Low Impact, High Effort (Avoid)**:
- Reorganize entire sales territory structure with minimal revenue upside

### Example 100-Day Plan

**Weeks 1–4: Stabilization**
- Retention bonuses paid to top 10 employees
- CFO calls top 20 customers to introduce new ownership
- Operating partner conducts site visits to all locations

**Weeks 4–8: Quick Wins**
- Implement 5% price increase on Product A (impact: +$500K EBITDA)
- Renegotiate logistics contract (impact: +$200K EBITDA)
- Reduce discretionary marketing spend (impact: +$150K EBITDA)

**Weeks 8–12: Foundational**
- Hire VP of Sales (search initiated, target completion Week 12)
- Implement monthly KPI dashboard (CFO leads)
- Conduct strategic planning offsite with management

### Ownership and Accountability

Each initiative must have:
- **Owner**: Who is responsible? (CEO, CFO, Operating Partner)
- **Milestone**: What is the deliverable? (Contract signed, hire made, system live)
- **Deadline**: When is it due?
- **Success metric**: How do we measure success? (EBITDA impact, customer retention, time-to-hire)

**Example**:

| Initiative | Owner | Milestone | Deadline | Success Metric |
|------------|-------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| 5% price increase on Product A | VP Sales | New pricing implemented | Week 6 | $500K incremental EBITDA in Q2 |
| Hire VP of Sales | CEO | Offer accepted | Week 12 | Role filled with qualified candidate |
| Implement KPI dashboard | CFO | Dashboard live | Week 10 | Management reviews weekly |

### Communicating the 100-Day Plan to Management

**Initial presentation (Week 1 post-close)**:

Present the plan to management team in collaborative tone:
"Here are the priorities we believe will drive the most value in the first 100 days. We want your input on feasibility and any additional initiatives you recommend."

**Weekly check-ins (Weeks 1–16)**:

Track progress on each initiative. Flag delays or obstacles early.

**100-Day Review (Week 16)**:

Assess what was achieved, what was delayed, and why. Recalibrate for next phase (Months 4–12).

### Common 100-Day Plan Pitfalls

**Pitfall 1: Too many initiatives**

Overloading the plan creates execution fatigue. Focus on 5–10 high-impact initiatives.

**Pitfall 2: Unrealistic timelines**

Hiring a CFO in 30 days is unlikely. Allow realistic timeframes.

**Pitfall 3: Lack of prioritization**

All initiatives labeled "high priority" means nothing is prioritized.

**Pitfall 4: No ownership**

Initiatives owned by "management team" collectively often fall through cracks. Assign individual owners.

**Pitfall 5: No metrics**

If success is not measurable, you cannot track progress.

**Outline**:
- Purpose and structure of the 100-day plan (0:00–4:00)
- Stabilization, quick wins, and foundational improvements (4:00–12:00)
- Prioritization framework: Impact vs. effort (12:00–17:00)
- Example 100-day plan with initiatives, owners, milestones (17:00–23:00)
- Communicating to management and avoiding common pitfalls (23:00–30:00)

**Suggested Length**: 30 minutes

## Key Takeaways

- The 100-day plan prioritizes stabilization (retain key employees, maintain customer relationships), quick wins (pricing, cost cuts), and foundational improvements (hiring, systems, strategy)
- Prioritize initiatives using impact vs. effort framework: High impact, low effort initiatives go first; avoid low impact, high effort initiatives
- Each initiative requires clear owner, milestone, deadline, and success metric—avoid vague ownership ("management team") or unmeasurable success
- Communicate plan collaboratively to management in Week 1 post-close, track progress in weekly check-ins, and conduct 100-day review to assess achievements and recalibrate
- Common pitfalls include too many initiatives (focus on 5–10 high-impact), unrealistic timelines, lack of prioritization, no ownership, and no measurable metrics
- Balance ambition with realism—100-day plans are not comprehensive value creation roadmaps but focused first-phase priorities

## Synthesis
- What would change your mind based on new data?
- What breaks first in a downside case?
- What is the single highest-leverage next diligence action?
