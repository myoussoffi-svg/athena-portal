# KPI Reporting VS Value Creation

## Outcomes
- Build a work product you could share internally.
- Identify the decisions and risks this work supports.
- Execute a repeatable workflow under time pressure.

## Agenda
- Define the objective and decision context.
- Gather the minimum inputs needed.
- Analyze and pressure-test assumptions.
- Translate findings into implications and next steps.

## Why this matters in a real deal
This work determines whether the deal narrative survives scrutiny. Done well, it improves decision quality and surfaces risk early. Done poorly, it creates false confidence and wastes diligence time.

## Deliverable
- Produce a 1–2 page output (memo, outline, or analysis) that is decision-relevant and defensible.

## Checklist
- [ ] Scope and definitions are explicit.
- [ ] Key assumptions are stated and testable.
- [ ] Downside risks are identified and prioritized.
- [ ] Findings translate into underwriting implications.
- [ ] Next diligence actions are clear.
## Learning Objectives

- Explain the difference between performance monitoring (KPI reporting) and active value creation initiatives
- Evaluate when tracking metrics is sufficient versus when intervention and operational changes are required
- Develop frameworks for linking KPIs to actionable value creation levers
- Diagnose when management is "reporting to the board" versus actually driving improvements
- Structure KPI dashboards that enable both monitoring and decision-making
- Defend the balance between measurement discipline and avoiding over-reporting that distracts management from execution

## Written Guide

### KPI Reporting vs. Value Creation: The Distinction

**KPI reporting** = Tracking and presenting metrics

**Value creation** = Taking actions that improve metrics

Associates often confuse the two. Reporting is necessary but not sufficient. If KPIs are deteriorating, reporting the decline does not fix it.

**Example**:

**KPI reporting**: "Customer churn increased from 8% to 12% this quarter."

**Value creation**: "We implemented a customer success program, hired 2 CSMs, and introduced quarterly business reviews with at-risk customers. Churn target for next quarter is 10%."

### When Reporting is Sufficient

**Scenario 1: Business is performing to plan**

If revenue, EBITDA, and KPIs are on track, intensive reporting is appropriate. Focus on monitoring for early warning signs.

**Scenario 2: Issues are flagged early**

If KPI reporting surfaces a problem (e.g., sales pipeline declining), management develops a corrective action plan. Associate monitors execution.

**Scenario 3: Operating partner is driving value creation**

If an operating partner is embedded and leading initiatives, associate role is to track progress and report to investment team.

### When Value Creation Intervention is Required

**Scenario 1: KPIs are deteriorating and management has no plan**

Churn is increasing, but management has not implemented retention initiatives.

**Associate action**: Escalate to VP. Recommend specific actions (hire customer success lead, benchmark retention programs, engage retention consultant).

**Scenario 2: Initiatives are stalled**

100-day plan included "hire VP of Sales by Week 12." It is Week 16, and role is still open.

**Associate action**: Diagnose blocker (compensation not competitive? Search firm underperforming?). Recommend solution (adjust comp, switch recruiters).

**Scenario 3: Management is measuring but not acting**

CFO produces detailed KPI dashboards monthly, but no operational changes are made when metrics decline.

**Associate action**: Shift focus from reporting to action plans. "What are we doing differently this month to improve gross margin?"

### Linking KPIs to Value Creation Levers

Effective KPI frameworks connect metrics to actions.

**Example: Revenue Growth KPIs**

| KPI | Current | Target | Value Creation Lever |
|-----|---------|--------|---------------------|
| New customer acquisition | 50/month | 75/month | Increase sales headcount from 10 to 15 reps |
| Average deal size | $50K | $60K | Implement tiered pricing; upsell enterprise features |
| Sales cycle length | 90 days | 60 days | Improve sales enablement; streamline contracting process |

Each KPI ties to a specific initiative. If KPI does not improve, revisit the initiative (Is it resourced? Is it being executed?).

### Avoiding Over-Reporting and Analysis Paralysis

**Pitfall**: Management spends excessive time preparing board decks and KPI reports at the expense of running the business.

**Symptoms**:
- CFO spends 2 weeks per month on board materials
- Requests for new metrics every board meeting
- Management complains "PE firm is too demanding"

**Solution**:
- Standardize templates (reduce prep time)
- Limit KPI dashboard to 10–15 core metrics (not 50+)
- Rotate deep-dives (Month 1: Commercial, Month 2: Operations, Month 3: Talent)

**Guiding principle**: Reporting should inform decisions, not replace them.

### Structuring Effective KPI Dashboards

**Dashboard structure**:

**Page 1: Executive Summary**
- Revenue, EBITDA, Cash (vs. plan)
- Top 3 wins
- Top 3 concerns

**Page 2: Financial Performance**
- P&L summary
- Bridge from prior period EBITDA
- Cash flow and working capital

**Page 3: Commercial KPIs**
- Customer acquisition, churn, NRR
- Pipeline and bookings
- Pricing trends

**Page 4: Operational KPIs**
- Revenue per employee
- Gross margin by product
- Capacity utilization

**Page 5: Value Creation Progress**
- 100-day plan status
- Strategic initiatives update

**Frequency**: Monthly or quarterly depending on business volatility and maturity.

## Video Placeholder

**Video Title**: KPI Reporting vs. Value Creation

**Outline**:
- The distinction: Tracking vs. acting (0:00–4:00)
- When reporting is sufficient vs. when intervention is required (4:00–10:00)
- Linking KPIs to value creation levers (10:00–15:00)
- Avoiding over-reporting and analysis paralysis (15:00–20:00)
- Structuring effective KPI dashboards (20:00–25:00)

**Suggested Length**: 25 minutes

## Key Takeaways

- KPI reporting tracks metrics; value creation improves them—associates must push beyond reporting to drive actionable initiatives when performance deteriorates
- Reporting is sufficient when business is on track, issues are flagged early with corrective plans, or operating partners are leading value creation
- Intervention is required when KPIs deteriorate without management response, initiatives stall, or management measures but does not act
- Link each KPI to a specific value creation lever (e.g., new customer acquisition → hire more sales reps; churn → implement customer success program)
- Avoid over-reporting by standardizing templates, limiting dashboards to 10–15 core metrics, and rotating deep-dives—reporting should inform decisions, not replace execution
- Structure dashboards with executive summary, financials, commercial/operational KPIs, and value creation progress—keep concise and actionable
