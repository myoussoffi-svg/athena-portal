- Identify when organizational dysfunction or cultural misalignment could undermine value creation post-close

## Written Guide

### Why Organizational Analysis is Critical in PE Diligence

People execute the value creation plan. A business with strong financials but weak organizational health is a high-risk investment.

Organizational diligence answers:
- Who are the key people that drive performance, and are they likely to stay post-close?
- Is turnover at healthy levels, or is the business losing critical talent?
- Are compensation structures competitive enough to retain top performers?
- Does the organization have the capacity to scale, or will growth require significant hiring?
- Are there succession plans for critical roles, or is performance dependent on irreplaceable individuals?

Associates who neglect organizational diligence miss risks that can destroy value post-close: key executive departures, mass attrition in critical functions, or cultural resistance to PE ownership.

### Requesting Organizational Data in the DRL

Your DRL should request:
- **Org chart**: Current structure with names, titles, reporting lines, and tenure for all employees (or at minimum, director level and above)
- **Headcount data**: Total headcount by department and role for FY21–FY23 (monthly if available)
- **Turnover data**: Voluntary and involuntary turnover by department and role for FY21–FY23
- **Compensation data**: Base salary, bonus, and equity for top 20–30 employees; compensation bands by role and level
- **Equity ownership**: Cap table showing employee equity holdings and vesting schedules
- **Retention agreements**: Any change-of-control bonuses, retention agreements, or severance obligations
- **Open roles**: Current job openings and time-to-fill metrics
- **Performance reviews**: Recent performance review summaries or talent assessments (if available)

### Analyzing Organizational Structure: Span of Control and Layers

**Assessing the org chart**:

1. **Reporting structure clarity**: Is the reporting structure clear, or are there dual-reporting lines, ambiguous ownership, or flat structures with excessive direct reports?

2. **Span of control**: How many direct reports does each manager have? Best practice is 5–10 direct reports for operational roles; 3–7 for strategic leadership roles.
   - **Too narrow** (<3 direct reports): Suggests over-layering and bureaucracy
   - **Too wide** (>12 direct reports): Suggests under-management and lack of oversight

3. **Organizational layers**: How many layers exist between the CEO and front-line employees?
   - **Too many layers** (>5 for a mid-sized company): Slow decision-making, high overhead
   - **Too few layers** (<3 for a 200+ person company): Lack of middle management, scalability constraints

4. **Functional gaps**: Are there critical functions missing (e.g., no CFO, no head of sales, no CHRO)?

**Red flags in org structure**:
- CEO with 15+ direct reports (indicates lack of senior leadership team)
- Critical functions (finance, sales, operations) reporting to non-functional leaders
- Recently created layers that did not exist 12 months ago (may signal bloat)

### Employee Turnover Analysis: Voluntary vs. Involuntary, by Function

**Calculating turnover rate**:

**Formula**:
Turnover Rate = (Number of Departures / Average Headcount) × 100

**Breakdowns required**:
1. **Voluntary vs. involuntary**: Voluntary turnover (employee chose to leave) is a retention risk. Involuntary turnover (terminations, layoffs) may reflect performance management or restructuring.

2. **By department**: Sales, engineering, operations, G&A. Turnover in revenue-generating or product-critical roles is higher risk than G&A turnover.

3. **By tenure**: Are new hires leaving within 12 months (onboarding or cultural fit issue)? Or are long-tenured employees leaving (sign of deteriorating culture or competitive threats)?

4. **By role level**: Executive turnover is more concerning than individual contributor turnover.

**Benchmarking turnover**:

| Industry/Role | Healthy Turnover | Elevated Turnover | Red Flag Turnover |
|---------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Technology (engineering) | <10% | 10–15% | >15% |
| Sales | 10–15% | 15–25% | >25% |
| Operations/manufacturing | <8% | 8–12% | >12% |
| Corporate/G&A | <10% | 10–15% | >15% |

**Example turnover table**:

| Department | FY21 Turnover | FY22 Turnover | FY23 Turnover | Trend | Benchmark | Assessment |
|------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|-------|-----------|------------|
| Sales | 12% | 18% | 22% | ↑ | 10–15% | Elevated; investigate |
| Engineering | 8% | 9% | 11% | ↑ | <10% | Slightly elevated |
| Operations | 6% | 7% | 7% | → | <8% | Healthy |
| G&A | 10% | 8% | 9% | → | <10% | Healthy |

**Interpretation**:
Sales turnover is increasing and above benchmark. This is a red flag requiring investigation:
- Are top performers leaving for competitors?
- Is compensation uncompetitive?
- Is the sales organization poorly managed?
- Is quota attainment declining, leading to rep burnout?

### Key Person Risk Assessment

Key person risk arises when performance or institutional knowledge is concentrated in a small number of individuals whose departure would materially harm the business.

**Identifying key persons**:

1. **Revenue-critical roles**: Who owns the top customer relationships? Who leads the sales team?

2. **Product-critical roles**: Who built the core technology? Who maintains the IP or proprietary processes?

3. **Operational-critical roles**: Who runs the factory or supply chain? Who manages vendor relationships?

4. **Leadership-critical roles**: CEO, CFO, CTO, CRO—whose departure would destabilize the organization?

**Assessing key person risk severity**:

**Low risk**:
- Key person has a strong second-in-command with overlapping knowledge
- Documented processes and systems reduce dependency on individuals
- Equity or retention incentives ensure key person stays through transition

**Medium risk**:
- Key person is essential but has some backup; transition would be disruptive but not fatal
- Retention is uncertain; no long-term equity or contractual lock-in

**High risk**:
- Key person is irreplaceable in the short term (no backup, undocumented knowledge)
- Key person has indicated intent to leave post-close or has been with the company <2 years
- Loss of key person would result in customer churn, product degradation, or operational failure

**Mitigating key person risk**:

1. **Retention agreements**: Negotiate stay bonuses or earnouts for critical employees
2. **Equity rollovers**: Offer key employees the opportunity to roll equity into the new deal
3. **Succession planning**: Identify and develop internal successors during diligence
4. **Knowledge transfer**: Build documentation and cross-training plans to reduce concentration

**Escalation trigger**:
If a key person is critical to thesis execution and retention is uncertain, escalate immediately to your VP. This may affect valuation, deal structure, or the investment decision.

### Compensation Analysis: Competitiveness and Retention Risk

**Benchmarking compensation**:

Compare target company compensation to:
- **Market data**: Use compensation survey data (Radford, Mercer, Payscale) by role and geography
- **Public company comps**: Public filings (proxy statements) for comparable companies
- **Portfolio company data**: Internal benchmarks from other PE-owned businesses in similar sectors

**Compensation structure**:

1. **Base salary**: Is base competitive with market 50th percentile (median) or higher?

2. **Bonus/variable comp**: What % of total comp is performance-based? Is it tied to individual, team, or company performance?

3. **Equity**: What % of employees have equity? Are grants meaningful or token amounts?

4. **Benefits**: Health insurance, 401k match, PTO—are they competitive?

**Red flags in compensation**:

- **Below-market comp**: Base salaries 10–20% below market median signal retention risk, especially in tight labor markets
- **No equity for key employees**: In growth-stage companies, lack of equity limits retention and alignment
- **Inconsistent comp philosophy**: Some roles overpaid, others underpaid—suggests lack of disciplined comp structure
- **High cash burn on comp**: Total comp as % of revenue is above industry norms, suggesting inefficiency

**Assessing retention risk based on comp**:

| Role | Current Base | Market Median | Gap | Equity? | Retention Risk |
|------|--------------|---------------|-----|---------|----------------|
| VP Sales | $180K | $220K | -18% | No | High |
| Lead Engineer | $150K | $160K | -6% | Yes (1% equity) | Low |
| CFO | $200K | $200K | 0% | Yes (2% equity) | Low |

In this example, VP Sales is underpaid with no equity—high risk of departure if approached by competitors or after change of control.

### Equity Ownership and Vesting Schedules

**Analyzing the cap table**:

1. **Who owns equity?** Founders, executives, employees, outside investors?

2. **How much equity do key employees have?** Is it enough to create meaningful retention and alignment?

3. **What are the vesting schedules?** Are key employees fully vested (no golden handcuffs) or partially vested (incentive to stay)?

4. **What happens at change of control?** Does equity accelerate (all unvested shares vest immediately) or continue vesting?

**Change-of-control considerations**:

- **Full acceleration**: All employees become fully vested at close. This is favorable for employees but removes retention incentive.
- **Partial acceleration**: 50% of unvested equity accelerates; remainder continues vesting. Balances employee payout with retention.
- **No acceleration**: Vesting continues on original schedule. Maximizes retention but may frustrate employees expecting liquidity.

Your job is to model the equity payout at close and assess whether key employees have sufficient incentive to stay post-close. If a VP is fully vested and cashing out $2M at close, retention risk is high unless you structure a new equity grant or retention bonus.

### Assessing Organizational Capacity to Scale

**Headcount growth analysis**:

| Department | FY21 HC | FY22 HC | FY23 HC | Growth | Revenue/Employee FY23 |
|------------|---------|---------|---------|--------|-----------------------|
| Sales | 20 | 25 | 30 | 50% | $3.3M |
| Engineering | 30 | 35 | 40 | 33% | $2.5M |
| Operations | 50 | 55 | 60 | 20% | $1.7M |
| G&A | 10 | 12 | 15 | 50% | $6.7M |
| **Total** | **110** | **127** | **145** | **32%** | **$690K** |

**Analysis questions**:

1. **Is headcount growth aligned with revenue growth?** If revenue grew 10% but headcount grew 30%, this suggests declining productivity or over-hiring.

2. **Where is hiring concentrated?** If G&A is growing faster than revenue-generating functions, this signals inefficiency.

3. **What is revenue per employee trend?** Declining revenue per employee suggests the business is not scaling efficiently.

4. **Can the business scale further without significant hiring?** If all teams are near capacity, growth will require proportional headcount increases (and corresponding OpEx).

**Scalability assessment**:

- **High scalability**: Software businesses with high gross margins and low incremental headcount needs
- **Low scalability**: Service businesses where revenue growth requires proportional headcount growth

Understanding scalability informs whether the business can achieve projected growth within budgeted OpEx, or whether significant hiring (and margin compression) is required.

### Red Flags in Organizational Analysis

**Red Flag 1: Recent executive departures**
If the CFO, CRO, or CTO left in the past 6 months, investigate:
- Why did they leave?
- Were they pushed out, or did they leave voluntarily?
- Has a replacement been hired, or is the role vacant?

**Red Flag 2: High turnover in revenue-critical roles**
If sales or customer success turnover exceeds 25%, the business may struggle to retain customers or execute growth plans.

**Red Flag 3: Lack of succession planning**
If key roles have no identified successors, the business is fragile and dependent on individuals.

**Red Flag 4: Equity fully vested for all key employees**
If the team has no unvested equity and limited retention incentives, post-close attrition risk is high.

**Red Flag 5: Below-market compensation with no equity**
If comp is 15–20% below market and there is no equity upside, top talent is at risk of leaving for better-paying opportunities.

### Structuring Organizational Analysis for IC

Your organizational section should include:

1. **Executive summary**: "Organization consists of [X] employees across [Y] functions. Turnover is [healthy/elevated/concerning] at [Z]%. Key person risk is [low/medium/high] for [specific roles]. Compensation is [competitive/below-market]. Retention plan required for [specific individuals]."

2. **Org chart**: Visual representation of structure with key roles highlighted

3. **Headcount and turnover table**: Historical trends by department

4. **Key person risk assessment**: List of critical roles with retention risk and mitigation plans

5. **Compensation benchmarking**: Comparison to market for top 10–20 roles

6. **Equity analysis**: Cap table summary and vesting schedule implications

7. **Recommendations**:
   - Retention bonuses or equity rollovers for key employees
   - Hiring plan to fill gaps or support growth
   - Compensation adjustments to align with market
