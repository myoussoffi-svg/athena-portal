## Written Guide

### Why KPI Selection Matters in PE Diligence

Financial statements tell you outcomes (revenue, EBITDA, cash flow). Key performance indicators (KPIs) tell you the operational drivers that produce those outcomes.

Understanding KPIs allows you to:
- **Diagnose business health**: Are operational trends improving or deteriorating beneath stable financials?
- **Validate the thesis**: Does the data support claims about operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, or growth momentum?
- **Identify value creation levers**: Which metrics, if improved, would have the greatest impact on EBITDA or valuation?
- **Build defensible models**: Projections based on KPIs (e.g., "revenue = customers × ARPU") are more credible than top-down growth assumptions

Associates who rely only on financial statements miss early warning signs and fail to build conviction around operational improvement opportunities.

### Framework for Selecting Relevant KPIs

Not all KPIs are equally useful. Your job is to identify the 5–10 metrics that best explain business performance and align with the thesis.

**Categories of KPIs**:

**1. Growth and Demand KPIs**
Measure top-line momentum and customer acquisition:
- New customers acquired per period
- Sales pipeline value and conversion rates
- Backlog or bookings (future committed revenue)
- Website traffic, trial sign-ups, or lead generation metrics
- Market share or penetration rates

**2. Retention and Engagement KPIs**
Measure customer stickiness and product usage:
- Customer retention rate or churn rate
- Net revenue retention (NRR) and gross revenue retention (GRR)
- Active users (daily, weekly, monthly) for software or platform businesses
- Product usage frequency or engagement scores
- Net Promoter Score (NPS) or customer satisfaction ratings

**3. Unit Economics and Pricing KPIs**
Measure profitability at the customer or transaction level:
- Average revenue per user (ARPU) or per customer
- Average order value (AOV)
- Gross margin per transaction or per customer
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC) and CAC payback period
- Lifetime value (LTV) to CAC ratio

**4. Operational Efficiency KPIs**
Measure productivity and cost management:
- Revenue per employee
- Gross margin per employee (for service businesses)
- Utilization rates (e.g., billable hours / total hours for consulting; occupancy % for hotels)
- Inventory turnover or days inventory outstanding
- On-time delivery or fulfillment rates

**5. Financial Health KPIs**
Measure cash generation and working capital efficiency:
- Days sales outstanding (DSO)
- Days payable outstanding (DPO)
- Cash conversion cycle
- Free cash flow conversion (FCF / EBITDA)
- Working capital as % of revenue

**Selecting the right KPIs**:

Start with the thesis. If the thesis is:
- **"Improve sales efficiency"** → Focus on pipeline conversion rates, sales cycle length, quota attainment, revenue per sales rep
- **"Reduce customer churn"** → Focus on retention rates by segment, NPS, product engagement metrics, customer health scores
- **"Expand into new geographies"** → Focus on market share by region, new customer acquisition by geography, regional revenue growth rates

Avoid selecting KPIs simply because management tracks them. Question whether each metric is:
1. **Actionable**: Can management influence this metric through operational decisions?
2. **Leading or lagging**: Does this metric predict future performance (leading) or reflect past outcomes (lagging)?
3. **Measurable consistently**: Is the metric defined clearly and tracked reliably over time?

### Requesting KPI Data in the DRL

Management presentations often include selective KPIs designed to present the business favorably. Your DRL must request comprehensive, granular data.

**Effective KPI requests**:
- "Monthly new customer acquisition and churn by segment for FY21–FY23"
- "Revenue per employee by department (sales, engineering, G&A) over time"
- "Sales pipeline by stage with conversion rates and average sales cycle length"
- "Product usage metrics: DAU/MAU, feature adoption rates, session duration"

**Ineffective requests**:
- "Please provide KPI dashboard" (too vague)
- "Send all metrics you track" (generates noise; you must prioritize)

If management cannot provide historical KPI data, this is a red flag:
- Weak operational reporting systems
- Lack of data-driven decision-making culture
- Potential value creation opportunity to implement KPI tracking post-close

### Interpreting KPI Trends: Improvement, Deterioration, or Noise?

Raw KPI values are less important than trends. A business with 10% monthly churn is concerning unless churn was 15% a year ago (improvement trend).

**Analyzing trends**:

**1. Direction**: Is the KPI improving, stable, or deteriorating?

**2. Magnitude**: Is the change material or within normal variance?

**3. Consistency**: Is the trend consistent across months/quarters, or is there volatility?

**4. Inflection points**: Did the trend change recently? If so, what caused it?

**Example: Sales conversion rate**

| Quarter | Q1 FY22 | Q2 FY22 | Q3 FY22 | Q4 FY22 | Q1 FY23 | Q2 FY23 | Q3 FY23 |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Conv %  | 25%     | 26%     | 27%     | 28%     | 27%     | 25%     | 22%     |

**Interpretation**:
- Conversion improved from Q1–Q4 FY22 (positive trend)
- Conversion declined sharply in FY23 (red flag)
- Investigate: Did the sales team change? Did pricing increase? Did a competitor launch a new product?

**When to escalate KPI deterioration**:
- Decline is sustained over 2+ quarters (not a one-time anomaly)
- Decline contradicts management's narrative (e.g., they claim sales efficiency is improving)
- Decline threatens the thesis (e.g., thesis assumes conversion rates will remain at 28%; actuals are 22%)

### Benchmarking KPIs Against Industry Standards

KPIs are most useful when compared to benchmarks:
- **Industry standards**: What is typical for this type of business?
- **Best-in-class performers**: What do top-quartile companies achieve?
- **Historical performance**: How does current performance compare to the company's own history?

**Example benchmarks by business model**:

**SaaS businesses**:
- GRR: >90% (best-in-class >95%)
- NRR: >110% (best-in-class >120%)
- CAC payback: <12 months (best-in-class <6 months)
- Magic Number (New ARR / Sales & Marketing Spend): >0.75

**E-commerce**:
- Repeat purchase rate: >25% (best-in-class >40%)
- Average order value growth: 5–10% annually
- Cart abandonment rate: <70% (best-in-class <60%)

**Manufacturing**:
- Gross margin: 30–50% depending on sector
- Inventory turnover: 6–12× annually
- On-time delivery: >95%

**Service businesses (consulting, staffing)**:
- Utilization rate: >70% (best-in-class >80%)
- Revenue per employee: Varies by sector; compare to direct competitors
- Employee turnover: <15% annually (best-in-class <10%)

**Sourcing benchmarks**:
- Industry reports (e.g., SaaS Capital, Gartner, KeyBanc)
- Public company comps (if relevant peers exist)
- Prior PE deals in the sector (if your firm has comp data)
- Third-party consultants engaged for commercial diligence

**Using benchmarks in IC**:
"Target NRR is 105%, below the industry median of 110% and significantly below best-in-class of 120%. This suggests retention improvement is a viable value creation lever."

### Identifying KPI Manipulation and Gaming

Not all KPIs are reported honestly. Management may manipulate metrics to present favorable performance.

**Common manipulation tactics**:

**1. Changing definitions mid-stream**
- Example: Redefining "active customer" from "purchased in last 12 months" to "purchased in last 18 months" to inflate retention
- **How to catch it**: Request metric definitions in writing and confirm consistency across periods

**2. Cherry-picking time periods**
- Example: Reporting Q1 performance (strong) but omitting Q2–Q4 (weak)
- **How to catch it**: Always request data for full fiscal years and trailing twelve months (TTM)

**3. Excluding unfavorable segments**
- Example: Reporting churn for enterprise customers only (5%) but omitting SMB churn (25%)
- **How to catch it**: Request KPIs broken down by all segments, not just aggregates

**4. Gaming the numerator or denominator**
- Example: Reporting "revenue per employee" but excluding contractors from headcount to inflate the metric
- **How to catch it**: Verify how metrics are calculated and confirm denominators include all relevant costs or headcount

**5. Lagging or leading metrics selectively**
- Example: Highlighting pipeline growth (leading indicator) while obscuring declining bookings (lagging indicator)
- **How to catch it**: Track both leading and lagging indicators and reconcile them

**Red flag example**:
Management claims "customer retention improved to 92% in FY23 from 88% in FY22." But upon review, you find they changed the definition of "retained customer" to exclude customers who downgraded, only counting full churns.

**Escalation protocol**:
If you suspect KPI manipulation, document the inconsistency, cross-reference with other data sources, and escalate to your VP with a clear explanation of the issue.

### Structuring a KPI Tracking System for Post-Close Monitoring

Diligence is not only about assessing the business today. It is about establishing the metrics you will track post-close to measure value creation progress.

**Build a KPI dashboard structure**:

| KPI | Definition | FY22 Actual | FY23 Actual | FY24 Budget | FY24 Actual (Q1) | Variance | Trend |
|-----|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------------|----------|-------|
| New Customers | Logos added per quarter | 150 | 180 | 200 | 45 | -5 vs. budget | ↓ |
| Churn Rate | % of customers lost per quarter | 8% | 7% | 6% | 7.5% | +1.5pp | ↑ |
| ARPU | Monthly revenue per customer | $5,000 | $5,200 | $5,500 | $5,300 | -$200 | → |

This structure allows the deal team to:
- Track actual performance vs. budget
- Identify variances early
- Adjust value creation initiatives based on real-time data

**Establish KPI governance**:
- Define who is responsible for reporting each KPI (CFO, CRO, COO)
- Set reporting cadence (monthly board packs, quarterly deep dives)
- Build accountability into management incentive plans (tie bonus to KPI targets)

### Common KPI Pitfalls

**Pitfall 1: Tracking too many KPIs**
Dashboards with 50+ metrics create noise. Focus on the 5–10 that matter most.

**Pitfall 2: Confusing activity with outcomes**
"Number of sales calls made" is an activity. "Pipeline generated" is an outcome. Focus on outcomes.

**Pitfall 3: Ignoring qualitative context**
A declining NPS score may reflect a product bug that will be fixed, or it may reflect deteriorating competitive positioning. Numbers require context.

**Pitfall 4: Failing to link KPIs to financials**
Every KPI should connect to revenue, EBITDA, or cash flow. If improving a KPI does not improve financial performance, it is not a useful metric.

**Pitfall 5: Accepting vanity metrics**
"Total registered users" is a vanity metric if only 10% are active. Focus on metrics that reflect real engagement and monetization.

### Structuring KPI Analysis for IC

Your KPI section should include:

1. **Executive summary**: "The business tracks [X] core KPIs. Trends are [positive/mixed/negative]. Key findings: [specific insights]."

2. **KPI summary table**: Historical performance for 5–10 core metrics with trends and benchmarks

3. **Trend charts**: Visual representation of KPI performance over time

4. **Benchmarking analysis**: Comparison to industry standards with sources cited

5. **Key findings and implications**:
   - Which KPIs support the thesis?
   - Which KPIs signal risks or value creation opportunities?
   - Are there leading indicators of future performance issues?

6. **Post-close KPI tracking plan**: Proposed dashboard structure and governance
