# Designing the Management Presentation Agenda

## Learning Objectives

- Explain how to structure a management presentation agenda that balances relationship-building with rigorous information extraction
- Evaluate which topics require deep exploration versus surface-level confirmation based on diligence progress and thesis priorities
- Develop frameworks for sequencing questions to build from context-setting to probing follow-ups without creating defensiveness
- Diagnose when the agenda is too dense (overwhelming management) or too shallow (wasting the opportunity for critical insights)
- Structure pre-read materials and briefing documents that prepare management to provide useful, detailed responses
- Defend agenda design choices to VPs and principals when balancing completeness against time constraints
- Identify when to schedule follow-up deep-dives versus attempting to cover everything in a single session

## Written Guide

### Why Management Presentations are High-Leverage Diligence Moments

Management presentations are not status updates. They are structured opportunities to:
- **Test the investment thesis** by hearing management articulate strategy, competitive positioning, and growth plans
- **Extract information** not available in documents (strategic thinking, cultural tone, operational priorities)
- **Assess management quality** through their command of the business, transparency, and response to challenging questions
- **Clarify ambiguities** identified during VDR review or third-party diligence
- **Build rapport** that will be critical post-close if the deal proceeds

A well-designed agenda maximizes signal extraction while maintaining a collaborative tone. A poorly designed agenda either wastes time on superficial topics or creates adversarial dynamics that limit transparency.

Associates are typically responsible for drafting the initial agenda, circulating pre-read materials, and tracking follow-ups. Your VP will refine and finalize, but the quality of your draft determines how much refinement is needed.

### Timing and Context: When Management Presentations Occur

Management presentations typically occur at 2–3 key points in the deal lifecycle:

**1. Initial Management Meeting (Post-IOI, Pre-LOI)**
- **Goal**: Understand the business, meet the team, assess strategic fit
- **Duration**: 2–4 hours
- **Attendees**: CEO, CFO, CRO, COO; PE deal team (VP, associate, sometimes principal)
- **Tone**: Exploratory, relationship-building

**2. Deep-Dive Presentation (Post-LOI, During Confirmatory Diligence)**
- **Goal**: Validate thesis, resolve outstanding diligence questions, assess execution capability
- **Duration**: 4–8 hours (sometimes full day)
- **Attendees**: Full C-suite, functional leads; PE deal team and third-party consultants
- **Tone**: Rigorous but collaborative

**3. IC Prep Session (Pre-IC, Internal Only)**
- **Goal**: Final alignment on key risks, ensure VP can defend the deal
- **Duration**: 1–2 hours
- **Attendees**: Deal team only (VP, principal, associate)
- **Tone**: Internal stress-testing

Your role is most active in designing the agenda for the deep-dive presentation (Session 2), as this is where the bulk of information extraction occurs.

### Structuring the Agenda: Flow and Sequencing

A well-structured agenda follows a logical flow that builds trust before probing into sensitive areas.

**Standard agenda structure** (4–6 hour deep-dive):

**1. Opening and Introductions (15–30 minutes)**
- Brief intros from both sides
- Management overview of agenda and objectives
- PE team clarifies what has been reviewed and what remains outstanding

**2. Business Overview and Strategic Vision (45–60 minutes)**
- Management presents: company history, mission, market positioning
- Strategic priorities for next 3–5 years
- Competitive landscape and differentiation
- **Why this comes first**: Sets context, allows management to tell their story, establishes tone

**3. Financial Performance Deep-Dive (60–90 minutes)**
- Historical performance trends (revenue, EBITDA, cash flow)
- Revenue composition by product, customer, geography
- Margin drivers and recent margin trends
- Working capital dynamics and seasonality
- **Why this comes here**: Builds on strategic context with quantitative validation

**4. Commercial and Go-to-Market (60–90 minutes)**
- Customer acquisition strategy and sales process
- Customer retention and churn analysis
- Pricing strategy and elasticity
- Pipeline and backlog detail
- Top customer relationships and contract status
- **Why this comes here**: After financials, dive into revenue engine mechanics

**5. Operations and Product (45–60 minutes)**
- Product roadmap and R&D priorities
- Operational footprint (facilities, vendors, capacity)
- Technology stack and IT infrastructure
- Quality control and regulatory compliance
- **Why this comes here**: Operational detail builds on commercial discussion

**6. Organization and Talent (30–45 minutes)**
- Org structure and key roles
- Compensation and retention
- Cultural strengths and challenges
- Hiring needs and succession planning
- **Why this comes here**: People discussion is less quantitative; place after hard numbers

**7. Risks and Contingencies (30–45 minutes)**
- Known risks (regulatory, competitive, customer, operational)
- Scenario planning and downside mitigation
- Management's view of key risks and how they would address them
- **Why this comes last**: After establishing trust, management is more candid about challenges

**8. Closing and Next Steps (15–30 minutes)**
- Outstanding questions and follow-up commitments
- Timeline for additional diligence or documentation
- Schedule for next touchpoint

**Total: ~6 hours with breaks**

### Pre-Read Materials: Setting Expectations

Send a pre-read package 3–5 business days before the presentation. This allows management to prepare and ensures the session is productive rather than reactive.

**Pre-read package should include**:

1. **Agenda** (with time allocations and topic owners)
2. **Outstanding diligence questions** organized by topic
3. **Data requests** that management should prepare (e.g., customer pipeline detail, org chart updates)
4. **Key areas of focus** based on thesis (e.g., "We will spend significant time on customer retention and churn dynamics")

**Sample pre-read cover note**:

"In preparation for our management presentation on [date], please find the attached agenda and outstanding questions. We have completed our review of the VDR materials provided to date and appreciate the transparency thus far. This session is an opportunity to dive deeper into the commercial model, operational execution, and strategic vision. We have highlighted several areas where additional detail would be helpful, and we have requested updated data on customer pipeline and retention metrics. Please let us know if you have questions or need clarification on any items."

**What NOT to include in pre-read**:
- Internal diligence findings or concerns (save for the conversation)
- Valuation ranges or deal structure (not management's concern at this stage)
- Detailed IC prep materials (confidential to deal team)

### Question Design: Open-Ended, Probing, Non-Leading

The quality of the questions determines the quality of the answers.

**Question types and when to use them**:

**Open-ended questions** (use early in each section):
- "Walk us through how you think about customer acquisition strategy."
- "What are the primary drivers of gross margin variation across product lines?"
- "How do you assess whether the sales team is performing effectively?"

**Probing follow-ups** (use after initial answers):
- "You mentioned churn increased in Q3. What was the root cause?"
- "Can you quantify the impact of the pricing change on customer retention?"
- "What specific actions did you take when you identified the supplier issue?"

**Clarifying questions** (use when answers are vague):
- "When you say 'best-in-class,' what benchmark are you using?"
- "Can you provide an example of a customer who churned for competitive reasons?"
- "What does 'fully integrated' mean in terms of system architecture?"

**Challenging questions** (use sparingly, after rapport is established):
- "The VDR data shows margin compression in Product A, but the narrative describes it as a growth driver. Can you reconcile that?"
- "Your projections assume 20% growth, but historical growth is 8%. What changes to justify that acceleration?"
- "We noted that three sales leaders left in the past year. What drove those departures?"

**Avoid leading questions** that signal the answer you want:
- Bad: "Your retention is strong, right?"
- Good: "What is your gross revenue retention rate, and how has it trended?"

### Balancing Depth and Breadth: What to Prioritize

You cannot cover everything in one session. Prioritize based on:

**1. Thesis-critical topics** (non-negotiable depth):
If the thesis is margin expansion through procurement savings, spend 60–90 minutes on vendor relationships, spend analysis, and contract renegotiation opportunities.

**2. Known risks or red flags** (require resolution):
If diligence revealed customer concentration concerns, this must be addressed in depth.

**3. Information gaps** (cannot be answered from documents):
Strategic vision, management's risk assessment, cultural dynamics—these require conversation.

**4. Lower-priority topics** (can be deferred or covered briefly):
Operational details that do not affect thesis or valuation (e.g., office lease terms) can be summarized quickly or handled offline.

**Deprioritization framework**:

Ask: "If we do not cover this topic, does it change our investment decision or IC recommendation?"
- Yes → Must cover
- No → Defer or abbreviate

### Managing the Session: Associate Responsibilities

During the presentation, your role is to:

**1. Take detailed notes**
- Capture verbatim answers to key questions
- Note body language, hesitation, or evasiveness
- Track follow-up commitments

**2. Track time and agenda adherence**
- Signal to your VP if a section is running long
- Suggest breaks to maintain energy and focus

**3. Flag follow-up questions in real time**
- If management says "we can get back to you on that," note it immediately
- Draft follow-up email during breaks

**4. Identify contradictions or inconsistencies**
- If an answer conflicts with VDR data, flag it (diplomatically) during the session or raise with your VP during a break

**5. Assess management quality**
- Are they prepared? Do they know their numbers? Are they transparent or evasive?
- These observations inform the organizational risk section of the IC memo

### Red Flags During Management Presentations

**Red Flag 1: Management cannot answer basic questions about the business**
- CFO does not know working capital drivers
- CRO cannot articulate customer acquisition cost or payback period
- CEO is unfamiliar with top customer contract terms

**Red Flag 2: Evasiveness or deflection**
- Repeated "we'll get back to you" on important topics
- Vague answers that do not address the question
- Blame external factors (economy, competitors) without accountability

**Red Flag 3: Inconsistencies with prior statements or VDR data**
- Management describes churn as "low" but data shows 20% annual churn
- Revenue growth narrative does not match historical financials
- Management claims pricing power but has not raised prices in 5 years

**Red Flag 4: Over-reliance on a single individual**
- CEO answers all questions; CFO or CRO defers to CEO even on functional topics
- Suggests weak bench strength or command-and-control culture

**Red Flag 5: Defensiveness or hostility**
- Management reacts negatively to reasonable questions
- Unwillingness to discuss risks or weaknesses
- Suggests cultural fit issues with PE ownership

Escalate these flags to your VP immediately, either during a break or after the session.

### Post-Presentation Follow-Up

Within 24 hours of the presentation, the associate should:

**1. Circulate detailed notes** to the deal team
**2. Draft a follow-up email** to management with:
- Thank you for their time
- List of outstanding questions or data requests
- Confirmation of next steps and timeline
**3. Update the diligence tracker** with new information and resolved items
**4. Flag any red flags or concerns** to the VP in a separate internal memo

## Key Takeaways

- Management presentations are high-leverage opportunities to test the thesis, extract information not in documents, assess management quality, and build rapport for post-close collaboration
- Structure the agenda to flow logically from context-setting (business overview, strategy) to quantitative validation (financials, commercial) to operational depth (product, organization) to risk discussion
- Send pre-read materials 3–5 days in advance with the agenda, outstanding questions, and data requests to ensure management is prepared and the session is productive
- Design questions to be open-ended and probing, avoiding leading questions; use challenging questions sparingly and only after establishing rapport
- Prioritize thesis-critical topics, known risks, and information gaps that cannot be resolved from documents; defer or abbreviate lower-priority topics
- During the session, take detailed notes, track time, flag follow-ups, identify contradictions, and assess management quality and transparency
- Watch for red flags including inability to answer basic questions, evasiveness, inconsistencies with data, over-reliance on one person, or defensiveness—escalate immediately to your VP
