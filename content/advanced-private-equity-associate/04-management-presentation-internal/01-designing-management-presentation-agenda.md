# Designing the Management Presentation Agenda

## Outcomes
- Design a management presentation agenda that maximizes signal, not airtime.
- Sequence questions to surface risk, not rehearse the CIM.
- Use the agenda to control the meeting and extract decision-critical information.

## Agenda
- Understand the true purpose of the management presentation.
- Design an agenda that reflects diligence priorities.
- Sequence topics to build pressure and clarity.
- Use agenda design to manage time, tone, and escalation.

## Why this matters in a real deal
The management presentation is one of the highest-leverage moments in diligence. It is often the only opportunity to observe management thinking in real time, pressure-test narratives, and surface issues that documents will not reveal.

A weak agenda leads to scripted answers and wasted time. A strong agenda forces clarity, exposes gaps, and materially improves the quality of the investment decision.

## Deliverable
- Produce a management presentation agenda that:
  - Is structured around diligence objectives, not functional silos.
  - Prioritizes the highest-risk areas early.
  - Allocates time intentionally based on decision importance.
- Include 5–8 “must-answer” questions tied directly to underwriting assumptions.

## Checklist
- [ ] The agenda reflects the top risks in the deal.
- [ ] High-risk topics are discussed before low-risk areas.
- [ ] Each section has a clear purpose and desired outcome.
- [ ] Time allocation matches importance, not tradition.
- [ ] The agenda can be defended to the deal team in five minutes.

## 1) Understand the real purpose of the meeting
The management presentation is **not**:
- a company overview
- a replay of the CIM
- a marketing exercise

Its purpose is to:
- validate or challenge the thesis
- assess management credibility and judgment
- surface issues that do not appear in documents

If the agenda does not advance these goals, it is misdesigned.

---

## 2) Start from diligence priorities, not a standard template
Avoid generic agendas copied from prior deals.

Instead, ask:
- What assumptions are most fragile?
- Where do we have the least conviction?
- What could change valuation, structure, or go/no-go?

The agenda should be **deal-specific** and reflect what *this* investment requires to move forward.

---

## 3) Structure the agenda by decision area
Organize topics around decisions, not departments.

Examples:
- Market dynamics and competitive positioning
- Pricing power and customer behavior
- Growth initiatives and constraints
- Operational scalability and execution risk
- Financial quality and sustainability
- Legal, regulatory, or structural risks

This structure:
- keeps the conversation focused
- avoids siloed answers
- makes it easier to escalate internally afterward

---

## 4) Sequence topics to build signal and pressure
Order matters.

Best practice:
- Lead with the highest-risk or most uncertain areas.
- Defer confirmatory or lower-risk topics.
- Avoid ending with critical questions when time is tight.

Early sequencing:
- prevents management from “warming up” into rehearsed answers
- surfaces issues before fatigue sets in
- signals seriousness and control

---

## 5) Allocate time intentionally
Time allocation communicates priorities.

Do not default to equal time per section. Instead:
- Spend more time on areas that could break the deal.
- Compress sections where diligence is already strong.
- Leave buffer time for follow-ups and deeper probing.

If everything gets equal time, nothing is truly important.

---

## 6) Design questions to extract thinking, not facts
Strong questions reveal how management thinks under pressure.

Effective questions:
- force trade-offs
- challenge assumptions
- require specificity

Examples:
- “What would cause this growth plan to fail?”
- “Which customer segment would you deprioritize first in a downturn?”
- “What decision did you make that turned out to be wrong — and why?”

Avoid questions that can be answered with slides or memorized talking points.

---

## 7) Use the agenda as a control document
The agenda is a **tool**, not a courtesy.

Use it to:
- redirect the conversation when it drifts
- return to unresolved topics
- justify follow-up questions

You are not obligated to cover every section if time runs short. You are obligated to answer the most important questions.

---

## What a strong agenda signals to management
A well-designed agenda communicates:
- preparation
- seriousness
- decision discipline

It changes how management responds — often leading to more candid, less polished answers.

---

## What goes into the internal debrief
After the meeting, be prepared to discuss:
- What changed in your conviction — and why?
- Which answers increased or reduced risk?
- Where management credibility was strongest or weakest?
- What new diligence is required as a result?

The agenda should make this debrief straightforward.

---

## Synthesis
- Which agenda section matters most for go/no-go?
- What question are you most uncomfortable asking — and why?
- What answer would materially change valuation or structure?
