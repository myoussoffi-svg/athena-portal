# Deciding Whether to Continue Diligence

## Learning Objectives

- Explain the decision framework for determining whether to continue, pause, restructure, or abandon diligence based on findings to date
- Evaluate sunk cost fallacy risks and recognize when prior investment in a deal should not drive future commitment
- Develop frameworks for assessing whether newly identified risks are addressable through valuation adjustments, structural protections, or post-close mitigants
- Diagnose when thesis deterioration is gradual erosion versus sudden invalidation and adjust decision approach accordingly
- Structure the internal decision discussion with VPs and principals to ensure all perspectives are considered before committing additional resources
- Defend recommendations to pause or pass on deals when optimism bias or deal momentum pressures push toward continuing
- Identify early warning signals that a deal is unlikely to meet return hurdles or strategic fit criteria even if it reaches IC

## Written Guide

### Why the Continue/Pause/Pass Decision Matters

Diligence is expensive. Between third-party advisors (QofE, market studies, tax, legal), travel, and internal time, a typical mid-market PE deal incurs $200K–$500K in diligence costs and hundreds of internal hours.

The mid-diligence checkpoint is the moment to ask: Should we continue investing in this deal?

**Continuing when you should pass** creates:
- **Wasted resources**: Money and time that could be deployed on better opportunities
- **Opportunity cost**: Missing other deals because the team is tied up
- **IC distraction**: Presenting weak deals damages associate and VP credibility

**Passing when you should continue** creates:
- **Missed opportunities**: Walking away from deals that could generate strong returns
- **Reputation risk**: If the deal goes to a competitor and performs well, it raises questions about judgment

The decision must be disciplined, data-driven, and free from sunk cost fallacy or deal momentum bias.

### Decision Framework: Four Possible Outcomes

**1. Continue (Full Speed Ahead)**

**When to choose this**:
- Thesis is intact or stronger than initially believed
- Risks are identified but manageable and mitigable
- Management is credible, capable, and aligned
- Valuation and returns remain attractive
- Outstanding diligence items are confirmatory, not exploratory

**Action**: Proceed to complete diligence, finalize third-party reports, and prepare for IC.

**2. Continue with Adjustments (Restructure)**

**When to choose this**:
- Thesis is challenged but viable with modifications
- Risks are elevated but can be addressed through valuation reduction, earnouts, escrows, or structural protections
- Management gaps exist but can be filled post-close
- Returns are still acceptable at adjusted economics

**Action**: Engage with seller or advisor on price adjustment, structure changes, or additional diligence before proceeding to IC.

**3. Pause (Need More Information)**

**When to choose this**:
- Critical information is missing or delayed (e.g., QofE not complete, key customer renewal status unknown)
- Thesis-critical questions remain unresolved
- Third-party diligence has surfaced issues requiring additional investigation
- Timeline pressure is creating rushed analysis

**Action**: Halt incremental spend until outstanding items are resolved. Reassess once information is available.

**4. Pass (Walk Away)**

**When to choose this**:
- Thesis is invalidated by diligence findings
- Risks are unmitigable or deal-breaking (e.g., regulatory violation, key customer loss, management fraud)
- Valuation required to justify the deal is unrealistic given seller expectations
- Returns do not meet fund hurdles even under optimistic scenarios
- Management credibility is compromised
- Better opportunities exist for deployment of capital and team bandwidth

**Action**: Communicate decision to seller or advisor (typically VP or principal handles this). Conduct deal post-mortem internally to capture learnings.

### Assessing Thesis Integrity: Intact, Eroded, or Invalidated

The thesis is the foundation of the investment. Revisit it explicitly at the checkpoint.

**Thesis intact**:
Diligence confirms the core assumptions underlying the thesis. Risks exist but do not challenge the fundamental investment rationale.

**Example**:
Thesis: "Margin expansion through procurement optimization."
Diligence: Confirms vendor contracts are negotiable, spend is concentrated with high-cost suppliers, and comparable companies have achieved 300–500 bps margin improvement through similar initiatives.
**Decision**: Continue.

**Thesis eroded**:
Diligence reveals that some assumptions are weaker than expected, but the thesis can be adjusted or returns remain acceptable at lower levels.

**Example**:
Thesis: "Revenue growth through geographic expansion."
Diligence: Shows that prior geographic expansions took 18 months to reach profitability (vs. assumed 12 months) and required more investment than budgeted. Growth is still achievable but slower and more capital-intensive.
**Decision**: Continue with adjustments (lower valuation, longer hold period model, or revised value creation plan).

**Thesis invalidated**:
Diligence reveals that core assumptions are false or unachievable.

**Example**:
Thesis: "Customer upsell opportunity with NRR of 120%+."
Diligence: Shows that actual NRR is 95% (negative cohort retention after accounting for churn). Upsell rates are near zero. The business is a leaky bucket.
**Decision**: Pass.

**Framework for assessing**:

Ask:
1. What were the 2–3 core assumptions behind the thesis?
2. What does diligence say about each assumption? (Confirmed / Partially confirmed / Contradicted)
3. If assumptions are contradicted, can the deal still generate acceptable returns? At what valuation?
4. Is there a credible path to achieving the thesis post-close, or is it fundamentally flawed?

If the answer to #4 is "fundamentally flawed," pass. If the answer is "achievable but harder than expected," restructure.

### Avoiding Sunk Cost Fallacy

**Sunk cost fallacy**: The tendency to continue investing in a project because of prior investment, even when future investment is not justified.

In PE diligence, this manifests as:
- "We have already spent $300K on advisors; we should see this through to IC."
- "We have been working on this deal for 6 weeks; it would be a waste to walk now."
- "The VP has spent significant time on this; we owe it to them to finish."

**Why this is dangerous**: Past costs are irrelevant to the decision of whether future costs are justified. The only question is: Do future findings and returns justify future investment?

**How to combat sunk cost fallacy**:

1. **Ask the forward-looking question**: "If we were seeing this deal for the first time today, with what we now know, would we pursue it?"

2. **Quantify future costs vs. expected value**: "Completing diligence will cost $150K more and 100 hours of team time. What is the probability this deal closes? What is the expected return? Does that math work?"

3. **Celebrate no-decisions**: Firms that pass on deals based on disciplined diligence protect the portfolio from bad investments. Passing is a success, not a failure.

4. **Separate ego from decision**: If the VP championed the deal, it may be uncomfortable to recommend passing. But fiduciary responsibility to LPs requires honest assessment, not preservation of VP's ego.

### Recognizing Deal Momentum Bias

**Deal momentum bias**: The tendency for deals to gain inertia as they progress. Once a deal is "in flight," there is psychological and organizational pressure to see it through to IC, even when red flags emerge.

**Symptoms of deal momentum bias**:

- Team focuses on confirming the thesis rather than testing it
- Red flags are rationalized or minimized ("that is not that bad," "we can fix that post-close")
- Optimistic assumptions creep into the model to make returns work
- Dissenting views are dismissed or ignored
- Timeline pressure ("we need to get to IC by end of quarter") drives rushed decisions

**How to combat deal momentum bias**:

1. **Institutionalize the checkpoint**: Make the mid-diligence decision an explicit, formal gate. Require written recommendation and sign-off from VP and principal.

2. **Invite dissent**: Explicitly ask, "What would cause us to pass on this deal? Have we seen any of those red flags?"

3. **Pre-mortem exercise**: Ask the team, "Imagine we invested in this deal and it failed. What would the post-mortem say went wrong?" If the answer identifies issues you are seeing now, take them seriously.

4. **Benchmark against alternatives**: Compare this deal to others in the pipeline. Is this the best use of capital and time, or are there better opportunities?

### Structural Solutions: When to Adjust Deal Terms vs. Pass

Sometimes risks can be addressed through deal structure rather than walking away.

**Structural solutions to common risks**:

| Risk | Structural Mitigation |
|------|----------------------|
| Revenue or EBITDA uncertainty | Earnout tied to performance milestones |
| Customer concentration | Escrow for revenue clawback if key customer churns |
| Working capital volatility | Working capital peg with true-up at close |
| Management retention risk | Rollover equity or retention bonuses for key executives |
| Integration or execution risk | Longer earnout period; seller retains some economic exposure |
| Valuation disagreement | Seller note or deferred consideration |

**When structural solutions make sense**:
- The underlying business quality is strong
- The risk is quantifiable and time-bound
- The seller is willing to share risk (structure is only viable if seller accepts it)
- The adjusted returns still meet fund hurdles

**When structural solutions are insufficient**:
- The risk is existential (e.g., regulatory shutdown risk)
- The seller refuses to adjust terms
- The complexity of the structure creates more risk than it mitigates
- Even at heavily adjusted economics, returns do not meet fund hurdles

If structure cannot solve the problem, pass.

### The Internal Decision Discussion: How to Facilitate

The associate's role is often to facilitate the decision discussion by presenting the check-in memo and framing the decision.

**Best practices for facilitating**:

1. **Present the facts neutrally**: Lay out what was learned, both positive and negative. Avoid advocacy (yet).

2. **Frame the decision**: "The question is whether the risks we have identified are addressable at the current valuation, or whether we need to restructure or pass."

3. **Invite perspectives**: "VP, what is your view? Principal, what are you most concerned about?"

4. **Play devil's advocate if needed**: If the discussion is becoming overly optimistic, raise the counterargument: "What if customer retention does not improve? What does that do to our returns?"

5. **Document the decision and rationale**: Ensure there is clarity on the outcome and next steps. If the decision is to continue, document what conditions must be met.

6. **Escalate if there is disagreement**: If the associate believes the deal should pass but the VP wants to continue, escalate to the principal. Do not suppress dissenting views.

### Early Warning Signals: When to Pass Before Reaching Checkpoint

Sometimes red flags emerge early enough that you should pass before even reaching the formal checkpoint.

**Pass immediately if**:

1. **Fraud or material misrepresentation discovered**: Management provided false financials, fabricated customer data, or concealed liabilities.

2. **Regulatory or legal deal-breaker**: Business is operating in violation of law, faces shutdown risk, or has undisclosed material litigation.

3. **Thesis invalidated in first week of diligence**: VDR data immediately contradicts CIM claims (e.g., CIM says 90% retention; data shows 60% retention).

4. **Management refuses to cooperate with diligence**: Will not provide basic information, cancels meetings, or is hostile to reasonable questions.

5. **Better opportunity emerges**: Another deal in the pipeline is clearly superior and resources should be reallocated.

Do not wait for the formal checkpoint if the decision is obvious. Escalate to your VP immediately and recommend passing.

## Key Takeaways

- The mid-diligence checkpoint determines whether to continue, restructure, pause, or pass based on thesis validation, risk assessment, and return potential
- Assess whether the thesis is intact (continue), eroded (restructure), or invalidated (pass) by comparing diligence findings to core assumptions
- Avoid sunk cost fallacy by asking the forward-looking question: "If we saw this deal today with current knowledge, would we pursue it?"
- Combat deal momentum bias by institutionalizing the checkpoint, inviting dissent, conducting pre-mortems, and benchmarking against alternative opportunities
- Consider structural solutions (earnouts, escrows, rollover equity) to address quantifiable risks, but pass if risks are existential or returns do not meet hurdles even with adjustments
- Facilitate the internal decision discussion by presenting facts neutrally, framing the decision, inviting perspectives, and documenting outcomes and conditions for proceeding
- Pass immediately if fraud, regulatory issues, thesis invalidation, or management non-cooperation are discovered—do not wait for the formal checkpoint when the decision is obvious
