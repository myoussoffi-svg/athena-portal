# Translating Research into Diligence Questions

## Learning Objectives

- Convert market and competitive research into prioritized diligence questions
- Frame questions to test investment thesis and identify risks
- Design questions that elicit useful, actionable answers
- Structure diligence to address highest-priority unknowns first

## Written Guide

### The Role of Research in Diligence Planning

- Research identifies what you need to know
- Diligence answers those questions with data and evidence
- Good questions drive efficient, focused diligence

### From Research Insights to Diligence Questions

- Translating market sizing uncertainty into data requests
- Turning competitive threats into customer and supplier questions
- Converting moat hypotheses into tests and validation checks

### Structuring High-Quality Diligence Questions

- Open-ended vs. closed-ended questions
- Questions that reveal truth vs. questions that invite spin
- Sequencing: build-up questions before critical tests
- Framing questions to get honest, useful answers

### Prioritizing Questions by Impact

- Which unknowns matter most for go/no-go decision?
- Which questions test the investment thesis directly?
- Which risks, if confirmed, would kill the deal?
- Sequencing: high-impact questions early in diligence

### Examples of Research-Driven Questions

- Market: "What percentage of your revenue comes from [segment]? How has that changed over time?"
- Competition: "Which competitors do you lose deals to most often, and why?"
- Moats: "What would it take for a customer to switch to a competitor? Has anyone switched in the last year?"
- Growth: "What's your sales pipeline for [new product]? What's the conversion rate?"

### Avoiding Common Question Pitfalls

- Questions that are too vague or broad
- Questions management can easily spin or deflect
- Questions that assume facts not yet in evidence
- Leading questions that telegraph what you want to hear
