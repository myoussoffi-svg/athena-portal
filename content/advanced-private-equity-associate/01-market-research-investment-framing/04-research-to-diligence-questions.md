# Research to Diligence Questions

## Outcomes
- Convert market research into a short list of decision-critical diligence questions.
- Build a diligence question bank that is structured by risk and value driver.
- Produce a VP-ready diligence plan that prioritizes speed and signal.

## Agenda
- Identify 5-8 "IC questions" that decide the deal.
- Translate each into diligence questions, data requests, and validation methods.
- Prioritize by impact and uncertainty (not curiosity).
- Create an escalation-ready structure: what you need by when.

## Why this matters in a real deal
Early diligence is about signal, not coverage. Associates lose credibility when they ask for everything, learn nothing, and cannot connect findings to underwriting. A premium diligence plan is short, prioritized, and explicitly tied to the investment decision.

## Deliverable
- Build a "Diligence Question Map" with:
  - 5-8 IC questions
  - For each: diligence questions, data requests, validation method, owner, timing
  - A final 1-page "Week 1 Diligence Priorities" summary

## Checklist
- [ ] Each question ties to a value driver or a downside risk.
- [ ] Every question has a validation method (data + people).
- [ ] Requests are scoped (time period, granularity, segment).
- [ ] Priorities are explicit (Week 1 vs later).
- [ ] Outputs translate into underwriting assumptions.

## 1) Start with the decision, not the request
Frame diligence around what IC needs to believe:

Typical IC questions:
- Is growth real and repeatable, or driven by one-time factors?
- Is pricing power durable?
- Are margins structurally sustainable?
- What is the competitive threat and why now?
- Is customer concentration acceptable and manageable?
- What breaks in a downturn?
- Is management credible and execution-ready?

Do not start with: "Send the VDR index." Start with: "What must be true for our underwriting to be defensible?"

---

## 2) Build a question map (impact x uncertainty)
Rank each IC question on:
- Impact: if wrong, does the deal fail or just reprice?
- Uncertainty: how confident are we based on initial info?

High impact + high uncertainty = Week 1.

Example:
- Pricing power is high impact. If we have no proof, it is Week 1.
- Market size might be high impact, but if multiple sources triangulate, it may be Week 2.

---

## 3) Translate IC questions into diligence mechanics
For each IC question, define:
- Diligence question (what we are trying to learn)
- Data requests (what we need to measure)
- People validation (who confirms or contradicts)
- "Pass/fail" thresholds (what would change our mind)

### Example: Pricing power
Diligence question:
- Can we raise price without losing volume or increasing concessions?

Data requests:
- Invoice-level pricing (last 24-36 months)
- Discounting and concessions by customer/segment
- Renewal uplift and churn by cohort
- Competitor pricing benchmarks (where available)

People validation:
- Top 10 customers (buying behavior, switching constraints)
- Sales leadership (deal stories, discounting pressure)
- Competitors/industry experts

Pass/fail thresholds:
- If realized price is flat while list price rose, probe concessions.
- If churn increases after price events, elasticity is real.

---

## 4) Use "minimum viable diligence" (MVD)
Ask: What is the smallest set of evidence that gives you conviction?

Common MVD patterns:
- One clean cohort view + 8-10 customer calls beats 200 documents.
- A pricing waterfall (list -> realized -> concessions) beats "pricing deck."
- A win/loss reason code audit beats "competitive overview."

---

## 5) Draft a Week 1 plan (tight, professional)
Week 1 objective: confirm/kill the core thesis and surface deal-breakers.

Template:
### Week 1 priorities (5-7)
1) Revenue quality and sustainability
2) Pricing power and concessions
3) Retention and churn by cohort
4) Competitive threats (who wins and why)
5) Unit economics and margin drivers
6) Management credibility and plan realism
7) Downside sensitivity: what breaks first

For each: define owner, deliverable, and date.

---

## 6) How to write diligence questions (quality bar)
Weak:
- "Provide customer list."
- "Provide pricing."

Strong:
- "Provide top 50 customers with revenue by month for 36 months, by product line, including start date, contract type, and renewal date."
- "Provide invoice-level pricing for top 20 SKUs/services, including discounts/concessions, by customer and date."

Make requests:
- Time-bounded (e.g., 36 months)
- Segmented (customer/product/channel/geography)
- Linked to a calculation you will perform

---

## 7) Convert findings into underwriting updates
Every diligence workstream should end with:
- What we learned (1-3 bullets)
- Implication for underwriting (what assumption changes)
- Remaining risk (what is still uncertain)
- Next action (what closes the gap)

This is what makes you sound like PE execution training, not a blog.

## Synthesis
- What are the 3 IC questions that decide the deal within 10 days?
- Which request, if denied or delayed, is a red flag by itself?
- What is the most likely "false positive" signal you must avoid?
