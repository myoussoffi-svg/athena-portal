# Closing Execution and Wire Mechanics

## Learning Objectives

- Explain the sequence of events and document execution required on closing day
- Evaluate closing checklists to ensure all conditions precedent are satisfied before funds are released
- Develop frameworks for coordinating wire transfers among buyer, seller, lenders, escrow agents, and advisors
- Diagnose potential closing delays and develop contingency plans
- Structure closing coordination processes including signature pages, funds confirmation, and document delivery
- Defend wire instructions and fund flows when errors or delays threaten to derail closing

## Written Guide

### What Happens on Closing Day

**Closing** = the day the transaction becomes legally effective. Ownership transfers, funds are wired, and documents are executed.

**Timeline**: Typically occurs 30–90 days after SPA signing (time needed for regulatory approvals, financing arrangements, final diligence)

**Key participants**:
- Buyer and seller
- Legal counsel for each party
- Lender and lender's counsel
- Escrow agent
- Title company (if real estate involved)

### Closing Conditions Precedent

**Conditions precedent** = requirements that must be satisfied before closing can occur

**Standard buyer conditions**:
- Reps and warranties remain true and correct
- No material adverse change (MAC) to business
- Seller has delivered all required documents
- Regulatory approvals obtained
- Financing commitment in place

**Standard seller conditions**:
- Buyer has funding available (equity and debt)
- No MAC to buyer or fund
- Buyer has delivered purchase price

**Associate role**: Maintain closing checklist tracking status of each condition. Flag unresolved items to VP with urgency.

### The Closing Checklist

**Comprehensive list of deliverables**:

**Seller deliverables**:
- Executed SPA and ancillary agreements
- Resignations of directors/officers (if required)
- Corporate resolutions authorizing transaction
- Certificates of good standing
- Title documents
- Intellectual property assignments
- Employee consents / releases

**Buyer deliverables**:
- Purchase price payment
- Financing documents
- Corporate resolutions
- Officer's certificates

**Mutual deliverables**:
- Escrow agreement (signed by buyer, seller, escrow agent)
- Transition services agreement (if applicable)

**Associate responsibility**: Track document execution, confirm delivery to all parties, flag missing items.

### Wire Transfer Mechanics

**Wire sequence** (coordinated to happen simultaneously):

**Step 1: Buyer confirms debt funding available**

Lender confirms loan has been funded to buyer's account.

**Step 2: Buyer confirms equity funding available**

PE fund confirms capital call has been satisfied.

**Step 3: Escrow agent confirms instructions**

Escrow agent confirms they are ready to receive and distribute funds per SPA.

**Step 4: Buyer wires funds**

- To seller (net purchase price after adjustments)
- To escrow agent (escrow amount)
- To payoff existing debt (if applicable)
- To advisors for transaction fees

**Step 5: Seller confirms receipt**

Seller's counsel confirms funds received.

**Step 6: Document execution and delivery**

Once funds confirmed, parties execute final signature pages and deliver documents.

**Step 7: Transaction closes**

Ownership transfers.

**Timing**: All wires must be initiated before bank cutoff (typically 2–3 PM local time). Missing cutoff delays closing by one business day.

### Common Closing Day Issues

**Issue 1: Delayed lender funding**

Lender has last-minute documentation issue; delays funding.

**Contingency**: Have backup equity commitment ready or negotiate temporary bridge from seller.

**Issue 2: Missing signature page**

Seller's board member is unavailable; signature missing.

**Contingency**: Confirm that missing signature is not a closing condition (minor party) or obtain electronic/scanned signature.

**Issue 3: Wire error**

Buyer wires incorrect amount or to wrong account.

**Contingency**: Immediately contact receiving bank to reverse wire; may delay closing.

**Issue 4: MAC claim**

Seller claims buyer breached a condition precedent; refuses to close.

**Contingency**: Legal counsel evaluates claim. If valid, renegotiate or terminate. If invalid, threaten litigation for specific performance.

### Post-Closing Deliverables

**Within 24–48 hours of closing**:
- Distribute final executed documents to all parties
- File UCC financing statements (for secured debt)
- Record title transfers (for real estate)
- Notify customers, vendors, employees of ownership change (if required)

**Within 30 days**:
- File corporate formation documents for new holding company (if applicable)
- Complete post-closing working capital calculation

**Within 60–90 days**:
- Finalize purchase price adjustments based on closing balance sheet

## Key Takeaways

- Closing is the day ownership transfers, funds are wired, and documents are executed—typically 30–90 days after SPA signing
- Closing conditions precedent (reps remain true, no MAC, financing in place, regulatory approvals) must be satisfied before funds are released
- Maintain comprehensive closing checklist tracking seller deliverables (resignations, corporate resolutions, IP assignments) and buyer deliverables (purchase price, financing docs)
- Wire sequence must be coordinated simultaneously: Lender funds buyer, buyer wires to seller/escrow/payoffs/advisors, seller confirms receipt, documents execute
- Initiate wires before bank cutoff (typically 2–3 PM) to avoid one-day closing delay—common issues include delayed lender funding, missing signatures, and wire errors
- Post-closing deliverables include distributing executed documents, filing UCC statements, recording title transfers, and finalizing working capital adjustments within 60–90 days
