# Funds Flow Construction and Review

## Learning Objectives

- Explain how to construct a sources and uses of funds statement for acquisition closing
- Evaluate all uses of funds including purchase price, transaction fees, debt payoff, and working capital adjustments
- Develop frameworks for modeling sources including equity, debt, rollover equity, and seller financing
- Diagnose errors in funds flow calculations that could result in funding shortfalls at closing
- Structure funds flow review processes with deal counsel, lenders, and finance teams
- Defend funds flow assumptions when lenders or limited partners question equity requirements or use allocations

## Written Guide

### What is a Funds Flow Statement

**Funds flow** (also called Sources & Uses) shows:
- **Sources**: Where money comes from (equity, debt, rollover, seller note)
- **Uses**: Where money goes (purchase price, transaction fees, debt payoff)

**Purpose**:
- Confirm sufficient funds to close
- Allocate costs among parties (buyer, seller, lenders)
- Guide wire instructions on closing day

### Standard Uses of Funds

**1. Purchase price to seller**

Total enterprise value minus rollover equity, seller note, and seller transaction expenses

**2. Debt payoff**

Existing debt being refinanced or repaid at close

**3. Transaction expenses**

- Legal fees (buyer and seller)
- QofE and other advisor fees
- Financing fees (lender legal, commitment fees)
- Bank fees and escrow agent fees

**4. Working capital adjustments**

If closing working capital < peg, reduce proceeds to seller

**5. Closing cash to target company**

Minimum cash balance required to operate post-close

**Example Uses**:

| Use | Amount |
|-----|--------|
| Purchase price to seller | $85.0M |
| Payoff existing debt | $10.0M |
| Transaction expenses | $3.0M |
| Closing cash | $2.0M |
| **Total Uses** | **$100.0M** |

### Standard Sources of Funds

**1. Equity from PE fund**

Investor capital

**2. Debt financing**

- Senior debt (bank loan or institutional term loan)
- Subordinated debt or mezzanine (if applicable)

**3. Rollover equity**

Management or seller retains ownership in new structure

**4. Seller financing**

Seller note payable post-close

**Example Sources**:

| Source | Amount | % of Total |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Equity | $60.0M | 60% |
| Senior debt | $35.0M | 35% |
| Rollover equity | $5.0M | 5% |
| **Total Sources** | **$100.0M** | **100%** |

**Leverage ratio**: Debt / EBITDA = $35M / $10M = 3.5×

### Constructing the Funds Flow

**Step 1: Start with enterprise value**

From LOI or SPA

**Step 2: Add uses**

All transaction costs, debt payoff, working capital needs

**Step 3: Calculate total uses**

**Step 4: Determine debt capacity**

Based on lender credit agreement (e.g., 3.5× EBITDA)

**Step 5: Calculate required equity**

Equity = Total uses - Debt - Rollover - Seller note

**Step 6: Verify sources = uses**

Must balance to the dollar

**Common errors to check**:
- Forgot to include transaction expense
- Double-counted rollover equity (included in both purchase price and sources)
- Miscalculated working capital adjustment
- Assumed debt capacity exceeds lender commitment

### Transaction Expenses: What to Include

**Buyer-paid**:
- Buyer's legal counsel
- QofE, market study, legal/tax diligence
- Financing fees (lender legal, arrangement fees)
- Bank fees, title insurance

**Seller-paid**:
- Seller's legal counsel
- Investment banker success fee (typically 1–2% of transaction value)
- Seller's advisor fees

**Negotiated**:
- In some deals, buyer agrees to pay seller's transaction expenses (reduces net proceeds to seller but simplifies negotiation)

**Rule**: Always confirm expense allocation in SPA. Do not assume.

### Reviewing the Funds Flow with Stakeholders

**1. Deal counsel**

Reviews to ensure all SPA provisions (purchase price adjustments, escrow, expense allocation) are reflected correctly

**2. Lender's counsel**

Reviews to confirm debt proceeds are allocated correctly and uses comply with credit agreement terms

**3. Finance team / CFO**

Reviews to ensure closing cash is sufficient for operations and working capital true-up is accurately modeled

**4. Limited partners (if required by fund docs)**

May review if equity commitment exceeds threshold requiring LP approval

### Pre-Close Funds Flow Updates

Funds flow evolves as diligence progresses:

**Initial LOI stage**: Rough estimate based on assumed transaction costs

**Post-IC**: Refined based on IC-approved purchase price and debt structure

**Pre-signing**: Updated based on final SPA terms (working capital peg, escrow, final expense estimates)

**Pre-closing (day before close)**: Final funds flow based on actual closing balance sheet, final invoices from advisors, and confirmed debt draw

**Associate responsibility**: Track changes and update model at each milestone. Flag material variances to VP.

## Key Takeaways

- Funds flow (sources & uses) shows where money comes from (equity, debt, rollover, seller note) and where it goes (purchase price, fees, debt payoff, closing cash)
- Standard uses include purchase price to seller, existing debt payoff, transaction expenses (legal, diligence, financing fees), working capital adjustments, and minimum closing cash
- Standard sources include PE fund equity, senior debt (based on leverage capacity), rollover equity, and seller financing if applicable
- Construct funds flow by starting with enterprise value, adding all uses, determining debt capacity from lender commitments, and calculating required equity to balance sources and uses
- Review funds flow with deal counsel (SPA compliance), lender's counsel (credit agreement compliance), and finance team (closing cash sufficiency)
- Update funds flow at key milestones (LOI, IC, signing, closing) to reflect evolving deal terms, expense estimates, and working capital adjustments
