# SPA Mechanics: Reps, Warranties, Indemnities

## Learning Objectives

- Explain the purpose of representations and warranties (reps and warranties) in a Stock Purchase Agreement (SPA) and how they allocate risk between buyer and seller
- Evaluate which reps are fundamental versus business-specific and prioritize review accordingly
- Develop frameworks for structuring indemnification provisions including baskets, caps, and survival periods
- Diagnose when seller requests to limit reps or reduce indemnification exposure are reasonable versus problematic
- Structure escrows and holdbacks that provide practical remedies for breaches
- Defend negotiation positions when deal counsel recommends buyer-favorable terms that sellers resist

## Written Guide

### What is an SPA

The Stock (or Share) Purchase Agreement (SPA) is the definitive legal contract governing the acquisition. It includes:
- Purchase price and payment mechanics
- Representations and warranties
- Covenants (pre-closing and post-closing obligations)
- Indemnification provisions
- Closing conditions

**Drafted by**: Buyer's deal counsel
**Negotiated with**: Seller's counsel

**Associate role**: Review SPA in coordination with deal counsel, flag business issues, track open points

### Representations and Warranties: What They Are

**Reps and warranties** are statements of fact made by the seller about the business. Examples:
- "The financial statements are accurate and complete."
- "There is no undisclosed litigation."
- "The company owns all IP used in the business."
- "All material contracts are in full force and effect."

**Purpose**:
1. **Disclosure forcing mechanism**: Compels seller to disclose issues (if a rep is false, seller must disclose it in a schedule)
2. **Risk allocation**: If a rep is breached (false statement), seller is liable for resulting damages via indemnification
3. **Closing condition**: If a rep is breached pre-closing, buyer can refuse to close

### Fundamental vs. Business Reps

**Fundamental reps** (apply to all deals):
- Organization and authority (company is validly formed, seller has authority to execute transaction)
- Capitalization (ownership structure, no undisclosed equity holders)
- Financial statements (accuracy of financials provided)
- Tax (tax returns filed, no outstanding liabilities)
- Title to assets (seller owns what is being sold)
- No undisclosed liabilities

**Business-specific reps** (tailored to this deal):
- Contracts (material contracts disclosed and enforceable)
- Intellectual property (ownership and non-infringement)
- Employees (no labor disputes, proper classification)
- Compliance (regulatory, environmental, data privacy)
- Customers (no material customer losses, contracts in good standing)

**Associate review focus**: Business-specific reps must align with diligence findings. If legal diligence found IP ownership issues, the IP rep must be qualified (e.g., "except as disclosed in Schedule X").

### Indemnification: How Buyers are Protected

**Indemnification** is the seller's contractual obligation to reimburse the buyer for losses arising from breaches of reps and warranties.

**Standard indemnification structure**:

"Seller shall indemnify Buyer for any losses arising from breaches of representations and warranties, subject to:
- **Deductible (basket)**: Buyer absorbs first $[X] of losses
- **Cap**: Seller's maximum liability is $[Y]
- **Survival period**: Claims must be brought within [Z] months of closing"

**Why this matters**: Without indemnification, buyer has no recourse if reps are false.

### Baskets and Caps

**Basket (deductible)**:

Buyer must incur losses exceeding the basket before seller is liable.

**Types**:
- **Deductible basket**: Seller pays losses > basket (buyer absorbs first $X)
- **Tipping basket**: Once losses exceed basket, seller pays all losses from dollar one

**Example**:
- Basket: $500K (deductible)
- Losses: $600K
- Deductible basket: Seller pays $100K
- Tipping basket: Seller pays $600K

**Negotiation**:
- **Buyer preference**: Low basket (e.g., 0.5–1.0% of purchase price), tipping
- **Seller preference**: High basket (e.g., 2.0–3.0% of purchase price), deductible

**Cap (maximum liability)**:

**Buyer preference**: High cap (e.g., 100% of purchase price for fundamental reps, 25–50% for business reps)

**Seller preference**: Low cap (e.g., 10–15% of purchase price)

**Market standard**: 10–20% cap for general reps, 100% cap for fundamental reps (fraud, tax, capitalization)

### Survival Periods

**Survival** = how long after closing buyer can bring indemnification claims

**Standard survival periods**:
- **General reps**: 12–24 months
- **Fundamental reps**: 3–6 years (or statute of limitations)
- **Tax reps**: Length of applicable statute of limitations (3–7 years)

**Why it varies**: Some issues (e.g., undisclosed liabilities) may not surface until months after closing.

**Negotiation**:
- **Buyer preference**: Longer survival
- **Seller preference**: Shorter survival (limits exposure window)

### Escrows and Holdbacks

**Escrow**: A portion of purchase price held by a third party (escrow agent) to satisfy potential indemnification claims.

**Standard escrow**:
- Amount: 10–20% of purchase price
- Duration: 12–18 months (aligns with general rep survival period)
- Release: Remaining escrow funds released to seller after expiration of survival period (minus any pending claims)

**Why escrow matters**: Provides practical remedy. Without escrow, buyer must sue seller to collect on indemnification claims (slow, expensive, uncertain).

**Holdback**: Similar to escrow, but funds held by buyer (not third party). Sellers prefer escrow (neutral third party) over holdback (buyer controls funds).

### Disclosure Schedules

**Disclosure schedules** are attachments to the SPA where seller discloses exceptions to reps.

**Example**:
- **Rep**: "There is no pending or threatened litigation."
- **Disclosure Schedule**: "See Schedule 4.10: Pending litigation includes customer dispute in amount of $50K."

**Associate responsibility**: Review disclosure schedules to ensure:
- All known issues from diligence are disclosed
- Disclosures are specific (not vague catch-alls like "various customer disputes")
- Disclosed items were accounted for in valuation or IC risk assessment

**Red flag**: Seller attempts to disclose broad, vague items ("all matters discussed in diligence") to avoid specific disclosure. Push back via deal counsel.

### Covenants: Pre-Close and Post-Close

**Covenants** are obligations seller must perform.

**Pre-closing covenants** (seller maintains business in ordinary course):
- No extraordinary transactions
- No large capital expenditures
- No changes to compensation
- No customer or employee losses outside ordinary course

**Purpose**: Ensures business does not deteriorate between signing and closing.

**Post-closing covenants**:
- Seller transition services (if founder staying for transition)
- Non-compete (seller cannot start competing business for 3–5 years)
- Non-solicitation (seller cannot poach employees or customers)

## Key Takeaways

- The SPA is the definitive legal contract that includes purchase terms, reps and warranties, indemnification provisions, covenants, and closing conditions
- Reps and warranties are seller statements of fact about the business that force disclosure, allocate risk, and serve as closing conditions
- Indemnification protects buyers from losses due to breached reps, subject to baskets (deductibles), caps (maximum liability), and survival periods (claim windows)
- Market standard indemnification: 10–20% cap for general reps with 12–24 month survival; 100% cap for fundamental reps with 3–6 year survival
- Escrows (10–20% of purchase price held for 12–18 months) provide practical remedy for indemnification claims without requiring litigation
- Associates review disclosure schedules to ensure diligence findings are properly disclosed and specific (not vague catch-alls)
- Coordinate with deal counsel on business-specific reps, flag discrepancies between diligence and disclosures, and track negotiation positions on baskets, caps, and survival
