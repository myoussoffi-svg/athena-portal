# DRL Structure and Prioritization Framework

## Learning Objectives

- Explain how to construct a comprehensive diligence request list organized by functional area and priority tier
- Evaluate which diligence items are critical path versus nice-to-have based on deal timeline and investment thesis
- Diagnose gaps in initial DRLs that could surface later as IC vulnerabilities
- Defend prioritization decisions when managing bandwidth constraints across multiple workstreams
- Structure DRL tracking systems that enable real-time status visibility for VPs and partners

## Written Guide

### Why DRL Structure Matters

The diligence request list is not simply a document checklist. It is the operational backbone of your entire diligence process. A well-structured DRL determines what information you collect, when you collect it, and how deeply you investigate each dimension of the business.

Poor DRL structure creates three failure modes:
1. **Missing critical information** that only becomes obvious during IC prep when it is too late to remedy
2. **Redundant or unfocused requests** that waste management's time and erode relationship capital
3. **Inability to track progress** which obscures bottlenecks until they become deal-breaking delays

Associates who master DRL construction gain visibility, control deal pacing, and position themselves as organized executors who can be trusted with increasing responsibility.

### Organizing the DRL by Functional Area

DRLs should be organized hierarchically by functional area, not by document type or chronological receipt. This structure mirrors how diligence workstreams are staffed and how findings will eventually be presented to IC.

Standard functional areas include:
- **Financial Performance**: Historical financials, KPI reporting, budget vs. actual tracking, working capital detail
- **Commercial & Revenue**: Customer contracts, pricing models, pipeline/backlog data, sales force structure
- **Operations**: Vendor agreements, cost structure detail, capacity utilization, geographic footprint
- **Technology & Product**: Product roadmaps, R&D spend allocation, IP portfolio, tech stack documentation
- **Legal & Compliance**: Material contracts, litigation summary, regulatory filings, insurance policies
- **Human Capital**: Org charts, compensation benchmarking, retention/turnover data, equity ownership
- **ESG & Risk**: Environmental assessments, cybersecurity posture, business continuity plans

Within each area, requests should progress from foundational documents (required to understand the business) to deeper confirmatory materials (required to validate thesis or quantify risks).

This structure enables you to:
- Assign workstream leads (internal team or consultants) to discrete sections
- Track completeness by area rather than by arbitrary document count
- Identify where diligence is lagging relative to IC timeline
- Tailor follow-up requests without re-reading the entire DRL

### Prioritization Tiers: Critical Path vs. Secondary vs. Optional

Not all diligence requests carry equal weight. Associates must distinguish between:

**Tier 1 – Critical Path**: Information required to validate the core investment thesis or assess fundamental deal risk. Without these items, the deal cannot proceed to IC or closing.

Examples:
- Audited financials or detailed P&L by segment if the thesis depends on unit economics in a specific geography
- Top 20 customer contracts if customer concentration is a key risk
- Cap table and existing investor rights if there is minority ownership complexity

**Tier 2 – Important but Not Blocking**: Information that adds confidence, enables better modeling, or surfaces risks that are manageable but should be known.

Examples:
- Detailed marketing spend by channel (improves understanding but does not invalidate thesis)
- Real estate lease abstracts (important for integration planning but not a deal-breaker unless there is a flagged issue)
- Employee engagement survey results (valuable context but not determinative)

**Tier 3 – Optional or Post-LOI**: Information that is useful for integration planning, value creation roadmap development, or post-close risk mitigation but does not affect the decision to invest.

Examples:
- IT disaster recovery runbooks
- Historical M&A integration documentation from prior acquisitions
- Detailed SKU-level profitability if the business has thousands of SKUs and the thesis is top-line growth

Prioritization should be explicitly marked in the DRL (e.g., via a "Priority" column or color coding). This allows your VP to scan the DRL and immediately understand what is blocking progress versus what can be deferred.

### Aligning DRL to Investment Thesis

The DRL must be thesis-driven. Generic DRLs—copied from prior deals without customization—signal that the associate does not yet understand what matters for this specific investment.

Before issuing the DRL, review the IC memo outline or deal thesis summary and ask:
- What are the 2-3 assumptions that, if wrong, would break this deal?
- What evidence do I need to validate those assumptions?
- What risks has the partner flagged as areas of concern?

For example:
- If the thesis is **margin expansion through procurement savings**, the DRL should include vendor contracts, volume rebate schedules, and historical spend by supplier. Generic questions about "procurement processes" are insufficient.
- If the thesis is **revenue growth through geographic expansion**, the DRL should request market share data by region, sales pipeline by geography, and detail on regulatory barriers in target markets.
- If the key risk is **customer concentration**, the DRL should request customer-level revenue and churn data, not just aggregate financials.

Thesis alignment also governs the depth of certain requests. If technology is not central to the thesis, requesting complete source code documentation is excessive. If technology is the moat, it becomes Tier 1.

### Common DRL Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

**Mistake 1: Requesting "all contracts"**
This is lazy and generates noise. Be specific: "Material contracts >$500K annual value" or "Top 20 customer agreements by revenue."

**Mistake 2: No follow-up structure**
The initial DRL will not capture everything. Build in a "Follow-Up Requests" section where you can append targeted asks as diligence progresses. This avoids the appearance of disorganization.

**Mistake 3: Ignoring what is already in the CIM or management presentation**
If the CIM included three years of financials, do not re-request them. Instead, request the underlying data (e.g., "Monthly P&L detail underlying the annual figures presented in the CIM").

**Mistake 4: Sending the DRL before it is reviewed**
Always have your VP or principal review the DRL before it goes to the target or their advisor. This is a client-facing document that reflects your firm's diligence standards.

### Tracking and Updating the DRL

The DRL is a living document. Associates are responsible for maintaining a status tracker that shows:
- **Document name** (as requested)
- **Priority tier** (1/2/3)
- **Status** (Pending / Received / Under Review / Follow-Up Required)
- **Date requested** and **Date received**
- **Owner** (who is responsible for reviewing this item)
- **Notes** (any context, e.g., "Partial data only, full set requested 12/5")

This tracker should be updated in real time and shared with the deal team on a weekly basis (or more frequently as the deal accelerates).

Your VP should be able to glance at the tracker and immediately identify:
- How much of Tier 1 is still outstanding
- Whether any Tier 1 items have been pending for more than 48 hours without response
- Whether follow-up requests have been issued and tracked

### Escalation and Bandwidth Management

You will encounter situations where:
- Management delays providing Tier 1 materials
- The VDR is uploaded in tranches, and key items are missing
- Diligence consultants request access to information not yet received

In each case, associates must escalate intelligently:
- If a Tier 1 item is delayed, flag it immediately to your VP with context (e.g., "CFO indicated financials will be provided by Friday; we are now at Monday with no update").
- If a consultant is blocked, assess whether they can begin work on other sections or if the delay is truly blocking. Communicate clearly to avoid inefficiency.
- If the VDR is disorganized or incomplete, raise this during the next management call in a diplomatic but direct manner (e.g., "We have noted that several requested items are not yet in the VDR; can we confirm the expected upload timeline?").

Do not wait until the weekly update meeting to surface a critical gap. Escalate as soon as the issue is identified.

## Key Takeaways

- The DRL is the operational backbone of diligence; poor structure creates blind spots, inefficiency, and last-minute IC scrambles
- Organize by functional area, not document type, to enable clear workstream ownership and progress tracking
- Use explicit prioritization tiers (Critical Path / Important / Optional) so the team knows what is blocking versus what can be deferred
- Align every request to the investment thesis—generic DRLs signal lack of understanding and generate unnecessary noise
- Maintain a real-time status tracker and escalate Tier 1 delays immediately; do not wait for weekly updates to surface critical gaps
- Review the DRL with your VP before sending to ensure it reflects firm standards and strategic focus
