# Tracking Outstanding Items

## Outcomes
- Build a work product you could share internally.
- Identify the decisions and risks this work supports.
- Execute a repeatable workflow under time pressure.

## Agenda
- Define the objective and decision context.
- Gather the minimum inputs needed.
- Analyze and pressure-test assumptions.
- Translate findings into implications and next steps.

## Why this matters in a real deal
This work determines whether the deal narrative survives scrutiny. Done well, it improves decision quality and surfaces risk early. Done poorly, it creates false confidence and wastes diligence time.

## Deliverable
- Produce a 1–2 page output (memo, outline, or analysis) that is decision-relevant and defensible.

## Checklist
- [ ] Scope and definitions are explicit.
- [ ] Key assumptions are stated and testable.
- [ ] Downside risks are identified and prioritized.
- [ ] Findings translate into underwriting implications.
- [ ] Next diligence actions are clear.
## Learning Objectives

- Explain how to build and maintain a real-time tracking system for outstanding diligence requests, follow-up questions, and unresolved issues
- Evaluate which outstanding items are blocking critical path activities versus which can be resolved asynchronously
- Develop escalation protocols that ensure high-priority gaps are surfaced to VPs and management without creating unnecessary noise
- Diagnose when delays in receiving information reflect genuine complexity versus avoidance or disorganization on the seller's side
- Structure follow-up communications (to management, advisors, and consultants) that are specific, diplomatic, and action-oriented

## Written Guide

### Why Outstanding Item Tracking is a Blocking Risk

Diligence is a race against time. The timeline from IOI to LOI signing is often measured in weeks, not months. During that period, you must:
- Validate the investment thesis
- Quantify key risks
- Build a defensible financial model
- Prepare materials for IC

Any delay in receiving critical information compresses the time available for analysis and increases the likelihood of last-minute scrambles or incomplete diligence.

Outstanding item tracking is the early warning system that prevents these failures. It allows you to:
- Identify bottlenecks before they become crises
- Escalate appropriately when delays threaten deal timelines
- Maintain credibility with management by demonstrating organization and follow-through
- Ensure nothing falls through the cracks during high-intensity deal periods

Associates who lack disciplined tracking systems become the bottleneck—either by failing to follow up on critical items or by creating chaos through repeated, disorganized requests.

### Building a Comprehensive Tracking System

An outstanding items tracker should capture:
1. **Item description**: What was requested (specific enough that someone else could follow up)
2. **Category**: Type of request (financial data, customer contract, operational metric, etc.)
3. **Priority tier**: Critical path (Tier 1), important (Tier 2), or optional (Tier 3)
4. **Date requested**: When the request was first issued
5. **Requestor**: Who on your team issued the request
6. **Owner on seller side**: Who is responsible for providing the information (CFO, legal counsel, operations lead, etc.)
7. **Expected delivery date**: Commitment from seller or advisor, if provided
8. **Status**: Pending / Partial / Received / Follow-Up Required / Closed
9. **Follow-up log**: Record of all follow-up communications (date, method, response)
10. **Blocker flag**: Yes/No indicator for whether this item is blocking other work

This tracker should be updated daily and shared with the deal team in a format that allows filtering and sorting (Excel, Airtable, or dedicated diligence software).

### Categorizing Outstanding Items by Impact

Not all outstanding items carry equal weight. Categorize each item by its impact on deal progress:

**Blocking items** (immediate escalation required):
- Required to proceed to LOI (e.g., audited financials for valuation)
- Required for third-party diligence to begin (e.g., customer list for commercial consultant)
- Required to assess go/no-go decision (e.g., material litigation details)

**Time-sensitive but not immediately blocking**:
- Needed within 1–2 weeks to stay on timeline (e.g., detailed P&L by segment for model build)
- Required for upcoming management calls (e.g., clarification on revenue recognition policy)

**Important but flexible**:
- Adds confidence or depth but does not change investment decision (e.g., historical marketing spend detail)
- Can be deferred to post-LOI diligence if necessary

**Nice-to-have**:
- Helpful for integration planning but not decision-relevant (e.g., IT system diagrams)

Explicitly mark blocking items in your tracker with a visual flag (highlight, bold, or separate tab). Your VP should be able to scan the tracker and immediately identify what is at risk.

### Follow-Up Protocols: When and How to Escalate

Outstanding items will inevitably slip past expected delivery dates. Your job is to follow up systematically without damaging the relationship or appearing disorganized.

**Tier 1 (Critical Path) Items**:
- **Initial follow-up**: 24–48 hours after expected delivery date
- **Escalation to VP**: If no response within 48 hours of follow-up
- **Tone**: Direct but professional ("We noted that [item] was expected on [date]. Can you provide an update on timing?")

**Tier 2 (Important) Items**:
- **Initial follow-up**: 3–5 business days after expected delivery date
- **Escalation to VP**: If no response after two follow-ups or if item becomes blocking due to timeline compression
- **Tone**: Diplomatic reminder ("We want to ensure we have all necessary information to complete our analysis. Can you confirm the status of [item]?")

**Tier 3 (Optional) Items**:
- **Initial follow-up**: During next scheduled call or update meeting
- **Escalation**: Only if specifically requested by VP
- **Tone**: Low-pressure inquiry ("If available, we would appreciate [item]. If not immediately accessible, we can revisit post-LOI.")

### Managing Follow-Up Communications

Follow-up requests should be clear, specific, and easy to action. Avoid vague or passive language.

**Bad follow-up**:
"We are still waiting on a few items from the DRL. Can you send an update?"

**Good follow-up**:
"We are following up on three outstanding items from the DRL:
1. FY21–FY23 audited financials (originally requested 11/15, expected 11/20)
2. Top 20 customer contracts by revenue (originally requested 11/15, no delivery date provided)
3. Detailed org chart with compensation bands (originally requested 11/18, expected 11/25)

Can you confirm the expected delivery timeline for each?"

This format:
- Reminds the recipient of the original request date
- Provides context on prior commitments
- Requests specific action (confirm timing)

Avoid sending follow-up emails for every individual item. Batch related requests into a single, organized communication unless an item is truly urgent.

### Tracking Partial Deliveries and Iterative Requests

Sellers often provide partial information in stages. For example:
- They upload two years of financials when you requested three
- They provide aggregate revenue data when you requested customer-level detail
- They send unsigned drafts of contracts when you requested executed versions

In each case:
1. **Acknowledge receipt** of the partial information
2. **Clarify the gap** explicitly ("We received FY22 and FY23 financials. Can you confirm when FY21 will be available?")
3. **Update your tracker** to reflect "Partial" status with a note on what is missing
4. **Assess impact**: Does the partial information allow you to proceed, or is the full data required?

Do not assume that because something was partially provided, the seller considers it complete. Explicitly close the loop on each request.

### Red Flags in Outstanding Item Patterns

Delays in receiving information can signal deeper issues:

**Pattern 1: Repeated delays on Tier 1 financial data**
- **Signal**: Possible accounting irregularities, incomplete audits, or management attempting to obscure underperformance
- **Action**: Escalate to VP immediately. Consider whether delayed financials should trigger pause on deal timeline.

**Pattern 2: Avoidance of customer contract details**
- **Signal**: Unfavorable terms, pending renewals, or recent customer losses
- **Action**: Flag as a diligence risk. Request explanation for delay before proceeding to LOI.

**Pattern 3: Disorganized or inconsistent responses**
- **Signal**: Weak internal controls, lack of preparation, or insufficient sell-side advisor involvement
- **Action**: Assess whether this reflects execution risk post-close. May inform integration planning or valuation discount.

**Pattern 4: Information provided contradicts earlier statements**
- **Signal**: Credibility issue or material change in business
- **Action**: Document the inconsistency. Raise with management in next call and assess explanation.

These patterns should be documented in your tracker and raised during deal team discussions. They may not be deal-breakers, but they inform risk assessment and negotiation strategy.

### Coordinating with Third-Party Consultants and Lenders

Outstanding items do not only affect your internal work. They also block external parties:
- **Commercial consultants** may need customer lists or sales pipeline data
- **Accounting firms** may need detailed financials or trial balances
- **Lenders** may need three years of audited financials and a covenant compliance summary

When third parties are delayed due to outstanding items, you are the central coordinator. Maintain a separate tracker section for third-party blockers and update consultants proactively:

"We have requested [item] from the target and expect delivery by [date]. We will forward to you as soon as received."

This prevents consultants from repeatedly asking for the same information and positions you as the organized point of contact.

### Weekly Outstanding Items Review

Establish a weekly cadence to review outstanding items with your VP or principal:
- **What was received this week?** (Highlight major deliveries)
- **What is still outstanding?** (Focus on Tier 1 and Tier 2 items)
- **What follow-ups were issued?** (Document communication trail)
- **What blockers exist?** (Identify items that threaten deal timeline)
- **What new requests were added?** (Explain rationale for new items)

This review ensures alignment on priorities and surfaces issues before they escalate. It also demonstrates your command of the diligence process and reinforces accountability on both sides.

### Tools and Systems for Tracking

While a well-structured Excel tracker is sufficient, some firms use dedicated diligence management software (e.g., DealVDR, Nexus, Midaxo). These platforms offer:
- Automated reminders for overdue items
- Integration with VDR platforms to auto-update status when documents are uploaded
- Shared visibility across deal team members and third parties
- Version control and audit trails

Regardless of tool, the principles remain the same: real-time updates, clear categorization, and disciplined follow-up.

- Build a comprehensive tracker that captures item description, priority tier, requestor, owner, expected delivery date, status, follow-up log, and blocker flags
- Categorize items by impact (blocking, time-sensitive, flexible, nice-to-have) and escalate Tier 1 delays within 24–48 hours of missed deadlines
- Structure follow-up communications to be specific, batched, and action-oriented—avoid vague requests or repeated individual emails
- Track partial deliveries explicitly, clarify gaps, and assess whether you can proceed or require full data before continuing
- Monitor patterns in delays (financial data avoidance, disorganized responses, contradictions) as signals of deeper risks or credibility issues
