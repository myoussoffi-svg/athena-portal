# How Investment Committees Evaluate Deals

## Learning Objectives

- Explain the composition, decision-making process, and approval criteria of private equity investment committees
- Evaluate which aspects of a deal IC members prioritize (thesis clarity, risk mitigation, returns, team conviction) and structure presentations accordingly
- Develop frameworks for understanding IC dynamics including partner disagreements, risk tolerance variations, and decision-making styles
- Diagnose when IC is likely to approve, request additional work, or pass based on presentation quality and findings
- Structure IC preparation materials (memos, presentations, backup analyses) that address standard IC questions preemptively
- Defend deal recommendations when IC members challenge assumptions, question diligence rigor, or express skepticism about thesis

## Written Guide

### What is an Investment Committee and Who Sits on It

The Investment Committee (IC) is the governing body that approves or rejects investment decisions for a private equity fund.

**Typical composition**:
- **Partners** (voting members): Senior leaders who have committed capital or carried interest in the fund
- **Principals** (sometimes voting, often non-voting): Senior investment professionals who present deals
- **Limited partners (LPs)** (observers, rare): In some funds, key LPs may attend as observers
- **Operating partners** (advisory, non-voting): May attend to assess operational feasibility

**Decision authority**:
- Most funds require **unanimous or supermajority approval** (e.g., 75% of voting members)
- Some funds have veto rights for certain partners (e.g., founding partners)

**Frequency**:
- IC meetings occur weekly, biweekly, or monthly depending on deal flow
- Each deal typically gets 60–90 minutes for presentation and discussion

**Associate role**:
- Associates generally do not present at IC (VP or principal presents)
- Associates prepare materials, attend as observers or note-takers, and provide backup support

### IC Evaluation Criteria: What Partners Care About

IC members evaluate deals based on a hierarchy of priorities:

**1. Thesis clarity and conviction** (Most important)

- Is the thesis simple and defensible?
- Does the deal team have conviction, or are they equivocating?
- Is the thesis differentiated from what other firms could execute?

**Red flags**:
- Thesis is vague ("good company in growing market")
- Deal team cannot articulate why this deal is attractive in 2 sentences

**2. Risk identification and mitigation**

- Have all material risks been identified and quantified?
- Are proposed mitigants credible and actionable?
- What is the downside case, and is it acceptable?

**Red flags**:
- Risks are minimized or ignored
- Mitigants are aspirational ("we will fix post-close")
- Downside case still loses money

**3. Returns and valuation discipline**

- Does the deal meet fund return hurdles (typically 2.5–3.0× MOIC, 25–30% IRR)?
- Is the valuation reasonable relative to comps and intrinsic value?
- Are projections credible or aggressive?

**Red flags**:
- Returns depend on heroic assumptions (revenue growth 2× market, margin expansion to best-in-class)
- Valuation is at the high end of range with no clear justification

**4. Diligence rigor and completeness**

- Was diligence thorough? Are there major open items?
- Do third-party advisors support the thesis?
- Has management been properly vetted?

**Red flags**:
- QofE not complete; IC must approve subject to final findings
- Major open questions about customer retention, regulatory compliance, or organizational capacity

**5. Team and management quality**

- Is the deal team competent and trustworthy?
- Is management capable of executing the plan?
- Are there key person dependencies or retention risks?

**Red flags**:
- VP has limited experience in this sector
- Management team is weak; plan depends on replacing CEO post-close
- Key employees have no retention incentives

### IC Decision Outcomes

IC meetings result in one of four outcomes:

**1. Approved**

- IC votes to proceed with the deal at proposed terms
- Deal team is authorized to finalize SPA and close

**2. Approved with Conditions**

- IC supports the deal but requires certain conditions to be met before final approval or closing
- Examples: "Approve subject to top customer confirming renewal," "Approve subject to QofE final findings showing no additional adjustments"

**3. More Work Required**

- IC has concerns or open questions that must be addressed before reconvening
- Deal team is asked to conduct additional diligence, revisit valuation, or restructure the deal
- Deal returns to IC in 1–2 weeks

**4. Pass**

- IC declines to invest
- Reasons: Thesis is weak, risks are too high, returns are insufficient, better opportunities exist

### IC Meeting Flow and Dynamics

**Typical IC agenda** (60–90 minutes):

**1. Deal team presentation** (20–30 minutes)

- VP or principal walks through IC memo or presentation
- Covers: Thesis, market, financials, risks, valuation, returns, recommendation

**2. Q&A and discussion** (30–40 minutes)

- IC members ask clarifying questions
- Probe assumptions, challenge risks, test conviction

**3. Operating partner or advisor input** (5–10 minutes, if applicable)

- Operating partner assesses operational feasibility
- Third-party advisor may present key findings (rare; typically summarized by deal team)

**4. Deliberation** (10–15 minutes)

- Deal team may be excused while IC deliberates
- Partners discuss and vote

**5. Decision communicated** (5 minutes)

- Decision is shared with deal team
- If approved, next steps are confirmed
- If more work required, specific asks are outlined

### What IC Members Look For in Presentations

**Clarity and structure**:
- Thesis is stated upfront and repeated throughout
- Slides are logical and easy to follow
- No unnecessary detail; backup is in appendices

**Data-driven conclusions**:
- Every claim is supported by data (financials, QofE, market study, customer interviews)
- Assumptions are transparent and benchmarked

**Balanced perspective**:
- Risks are surfaced, not hidden
- Downside case is presented alongside upside
- Deal team acknowledges uncertainties

**Conviction without arrogance**:
- VP demonstrates conviction in the thesis
- But also humility: "We do not have perfect information, but based on diligence, we believe this is attractive."

**Preparedness for questions**:
- Deal team anticipates likely questions and has answers ready
- If a question cannot be answered, the response is honest: "We do not have that data. We can follow up post-IC if needed."

### Common IC Objections and How to Address Them

**Objection 1: "The valuation is too high."**

**Effective response**:
- "We agree the valuation is at the high end of the range. However, we believe it is justified by [specific differentiators: best-in-class retention, proprietary tech, defensible moat]. Comparable transactions in this space have traded at [X–Y]× EBITDA. We are at [Z]×, which is within range."
- Show valuation benchmarking and justify the premium.

**Ineffective response**:
- "The seller would not accept a lower price."

**Objection 2: "What if customer concentration risk materializes?"**

**Effective response**:
- "We have modeled a downside case where the top customer churns in Year 1. In that scenario, EBITDA declines from $10M to $7M, but we still achieve 2.0× MOIC at exit assuming no multiple expansion. Additionally, we are negotiating an escrow for revenue clawback tied to customer retention for the first 12 months."

**Ineffective response**:
- "Management says the relationship is strong, so we are not worried."

**Objection 3: "This sector is getting crowded. Why are we differentiated?"**

**Effective response**:
- "You are right that capital is flowing into this sector. However, this specific sub-segment [describe niche] is under-penetrated. We have relationships with operating partners who can accelerate value creation. Additionally, our buy-and-build strategy differentiates us from financial buyers."

**Ineffective response**:
- "We think it is still attractive."

**Objection 4: "Management seems weak. Can they execute?"**

**Effective response**:
- "We share that concern. The CFO is strong, but the CEO lacks operational experience. Our plan is to retain the CEO through transition (6–12 months) while recruiting a seasoned operator to take over. We have engaged a search firm and identified 3 qualified candidates."

**Ineffective response**:
- "We will figure it out post-close."

### Preparing for IC: Associate Responsibilities

**1. Finalize the IC memo or presentation**

- Incorporate all diligence findings
- Ensure data is accurate and sourced
- Proofread for typos or formatting errors

**2. Prepare backup materials**

- Detailed financial model
- Advisor summaries (QofE, market, legal, tax)
- Customer concentration analysis
- Management bios and org chart

**3. Conduct a mock IC**

- Run through the presentation with your VP
- Role-play as IC members and ask challenging questions
- Identify gaps or weak points and address them

**4. Prepare answers to anticipated questions**

- Based on deal risks, draft Q&A document
- Ensure your VP has talking points for likely objections

**5. Attend IC as observer or note-taker**

- Take detailed notes on questions asked and feedback provided
- Track follow-up items if IC requests additional work
