# Risk, Mitigants, and Downside Framing

## Learning Objectives

- Explain how to identify, categorize, and quantify all material deal risks for IC presentation
- Evaluate which mitigants are credible operational plans versus aspirational hopes
- Develop frameworks for constructing downside financial scenarios that stress-test key assumptions
- Diagnose when downside cases are realistic versus overly pessimistic or optimistic
- Structure risk sections in IC materials that demonstrate thorough analysis without creating undue alarm
- Defend risk framing when IC members question whether risks have been fully considered or mitigants are achievable

## Written Guide

### Why Risk Framing is Critical to IC Approval

IC members are risk managers. They will approve deals with risks, but not deals where risks are hidden, minimized, or unmitigated.

**Effective risk framing**:
- Identifies all material risks
- Quantifies impact
- Proposes credible mitigants
- Shows what happens in downside scenarios

**Poor risk framing**:
- Minimizes risks ("management says this is not a concern")
- Proposes vague mitigants ("we will address post-close")
- Avoids downside modeling

### Identifying and Categorizing Risks

**Risk categories**:

**1. Commercial risks**: Customer concentration, churn, competitive pressure, pricing erosion

**2. Financial risks**: Revenue quality, margin compression, working capital volatility, debt covenant breaches

**3. Operational risks**: Key person dependencies, capacity constraints, supply chain disruptions, technology debt

**4. Legal/regulatory risks**: Litigation, IP infringement, regulatory changes, compliance failures

**5. Macro risks**: Economic downturn, interest rate changes, sector headwinds

**For each risk, document**:
- **Description**: What is the risk?
- **Likelihood**: Low / Medium / High
- **Impact**: Quantified ($M EBITDA or % of enterprise value)
- **Mitigant**: What can be done to reduce likelihood or impact?
- **Residual risk**: What remains after mitigation?

### Quantifying Risk Impact

**Example: Customer concentration risk**

- **Risk**: Top customer (30% of revenue, $15M) has contract expiring in 6 months
- **Likelihood**: Medium (20–30% chance of non-renewal based on relationship assessment)
- **Impact**: If customer churns, revenue declines $15M; at 70% contribution margin, EBITDA declines $10.5M
- **Mitigant**: Proactive engagement with customer; negotiate early renewal; escrow for revenue clawback
- **Residual risk**: Even with mitigants, 10–15% chance of churn remains

**Quantification allows downside modeling**: In downside case, assume customer churns in Year 1.

### Credible vs. Aspirational Mitigants

**Credible mitigants** have:
- Specific actions
- Assigned ownership
- Funded resources
- Track record of success

**Example (credible)**:
- **Risk**: High employee turnover (22% annually vs. 12% industry average)
- **Mitigant**: Implement retention bonuses for top 20 employees ($500K cost); hire VP of HR to build retention programs; benchmark comp to market and adjust below-market roles
- **Why credible**: Specific, funded, has worked at comparable portfolio companies

**Aspirational mitigants** are:
- Vague: "We will improve sales efficiency"
- Unfunded: "We will invest in customer success" (no budget allocated)
- Unproven: "We believe management can fix this"

**Example (aspirational)**:
- **Risk**: Gross margin declining
- **Mitigant**: "We will improve procurement and negotiate better vendor terms"
- **Why aspirational**: No specifics on which vendors, what savings, or who will execute

**IC will reject aspirational mitigants.** Either make them credible or accept the risk as unmitigated.

### Building Downside Scenarios

A downside case stress-tests key assumptions.

**Base case assumptions**:
- Revenue growth: 12% annually
- Gross margin: Stable at 60%
- Customer churn: 8%

**Downside case assumptions**:
- Revenue growth: 5% annually (assumes top customer churns, no share gains)
- Gross margin: Declines to 55% (competitive pricing pressure)
- Customer churn: Increases to 12%

**Resulting downside EBITDA**: $8M vs. base case $12M

**Downside returns**: 2.0× MOIC vs. base case 3.0× MOIC

**IC question**: "Is 2.0× acceptable?" If yes, deal has downside protection. If no, valuation must be reduced.

### Presenting Risks to IC Without Creating Panic

**Tone**: Professional, fact-based, solution-oriented.

**Structure**:
1. Acknowledge the risk explicitly
2. Quantify it
3. Present the mitigant
4. Show residual exposure
5. Demonstrate that downside is acceptable

**Example**:
"Customer concentration is a material risk. Top customer represents 30% of revenue. If they churn, EBITDA declines by $10M. We are mitigating through proactive renewal discussions and proposing an escrow for revenue clawback. In our downside case, which assumes churn in Year 1, we still achieve 2.0× MOIC, which meets our hurdle. We believe this risk is manageable."

**What not to say**:
"Customer concentration is not a big deal. Management says the relationship is strong."

## Key Takeaways

- IC approves deals with risks, not deals where risks are hidden or minimized—effective risk framing identifies, quantifies, and proposes credible mitigants for all material risks
- Categorize risks (commercial, financial, operational, legal/regulatory, macro) and document likelihood, impact, mitigant, and residual risk for each
- Quantify risk impact in financial terms ($M EBITDA, % of enterprise value) to enable downside modeling and valuation adjustments
- Credible mitigants have specific actions, assigned ownership, funded resources, and track records—aspirational mitigants are vague, unfunded, or unproven and will be rejected by IC
- Build downside scenarios that stress-test key assumptions (revenue growth, margins, churn) and calculate resulting returns—if downside returns meet hurdles, deal has downside protection
- Present risks to IC with professional, fact-based, solution-oriented tone—acknowledge risks, quantify them, present mitigants, and demonstrate downside is acceptable
