# Valuation and Returns Narratives

## Learning Objectives

- Explain how to construct and defend valuation using comparable company analysis, precedent transactions, and DCF methodologies
- Evaluate whether entry multiple and exit multiple assumptions are supported by market data and thesis execution
- Develop frameworks for building returns narratives that attribute MOIC and IRR to specific value creation levers
- Diagnose when valuation appears aggressive relative to comps or thesis and adjust or defend accordingly
- Structure returns presentations that show base, upside, and downside scenarios with clear drivers
- Defend valuation and returns assumptions when IC challenges purchase price, exit multiple, or growth projections

## Written Guide

### Valuation Methodologies in PE

**Three standard approaches**:

**1. Comparable Company Analysis**: Public company trading multiples (EV/EBITDA, EV/Revenue)

**2. Precedent Transactions**: M&A deal multiples in same sector

**3. DCF (Discounted Cash Flow)**: Present value of projected cash flows

**PE firms typically anchor on EBITDA multiples** because:
- Simple and comparable
- Directly tied to operating performance
- Standard in M&A markets

**Entry multiple**: What you are paying (Enterprise Value / LTM or NTM EBITDA)

**Exit multiple**: What you will sell for in 3–5 years

### Benchmarking Entry Valuation

**Steps**:

1. **Identify comps**: Public companies or prior transactions in same sector, size, and growth profile

2. **Calculate median and range**: e.g., Comps trade at 8–12× EBITDA, median 10×

3. **Assess where target fits**: Is target above, at, or below median? Why?

**Example**:
- **Comps**: 8–12× EBITDA, median 10×
- **Target valuation**: 11× EBITDA
- **Justification**: Target has best-in-class retention (NRR 120% vs. comp average 105%) and faster growth (15% vs. 8%)

**If valuation is at high end or above comps**, IC will challenge. You must justify with:
- Differentiation (better margins, faster growth, defensible moat)
- Strategic value (platform for buy-and-build)
- Competitive process (other bidders drove price up)

**If you cannot justify premium, reduce valuation or pass.**

### Exit Multiple Assumptions

**Conservative approach**: Assume flat or declining exit multiple

**Rationale**: Multiple expansion is not a reliable value creation lever. If market multiples compress, you are exposed.

**Example**:
- Entry: 10× EBITDA
- Exit (conservative): 10× EBITDA (flat)
- Exit (aggressive): 12× EBITDA (expansion)

**Conservative assumption forces value creation through EBITDA growth, not multiple arbitrage.**

**When IC will accept exit multiple expansion**:
- You are professionalizing a founder-owned business (legitimately repositioning for higher multiple)
- Sector multiples have structural tailwinds (e.g., SaaS multiples expanding due to recurring revenue preference)
- You are consolidating fragmented market and creating a platform (larger businesses trade at higher multiples)

### Returns Attribution: MOIC and IRR Drivers

IC wants to know: Where do returns come from?

**Returns bridge example**:

- **Entry**: $100M EV at 10× EBITDA ($10M EBITDA)
- **Exit**: $250M EV (2.5× MOIC)

**Value creation attribution**:
1. **EBITDA growth**: $10M → $20M = $100M value creation (at 10× exit multiple)
2. **Multiple expansion**: 10× → 12.5× = $50M value creation
3. **Debt paydown**: $20M
4. **Total value creation**: $170M on $100M invested equity = 2.7× MOIC (including leverage)

**IC will focus on**:
- Is $10M → $20M EBITDA growth realistic? What drives it?
- Is 12.5× exit multiple justified, or are you relying on multiple expansion?

**Best practice**: Attribute >70% of returns to operational improvements (EBITDA growth), <30% to multiple expansion or leverage.

### Base, Upside, and Downside Scenarios

IC expects to see three cases:

**Base case**: Most likely outcome

- Revenue growth: 12%
- EBITDA margin: 25%
- Exit multiple: 10× (flat)
- **Returns**: 3.0× MOIC, 28% IRR

**Upside case**: If value creation exceeds plan

- Revenue growth: 18%
- EBITDA margin: 28%
- Exit multiple: 11×
- **Returns**: 4.0× MOIC, 38% IRR

**Downside case**: If risks materialize

- Revenue growth: 5%
- EBITDA margin: 22%
- Exit multiple: 9×
- **Returns**: 2.0× MOIC, 18% IRR

**IC assessment**:
- Is base case achievable?
- Is downside acceptable (meets fund hurdles)?
- Is there upside optionality?

### Defending Valuation When IC Challenges Price

**IC challenge**: "You are paying 11× EBITDA. Comps are 9–10×. Why?"

**Effective defense**:
"We agree this is a premium to comps. However, target has 35% EBITDA margin vs. comp average of 22%. On an EV/Revenue basis, we are in line with comps at 4.0×. Additionally, target's growth (15%) is 2× the comp average. We believe the premium is justified."

**Supporting evidence**:
- Show valuation on multiple metrics (EV/EBITDA, EV/Revenue, P/E)
- Reference specific precedent transactions at similar multiples
- Demonstrate that growth or margins justify premium

**When you cannot defend**:
"We acknowledge the valuation is aggressive. If IC is uncomfortable, we can walk or renegotiate. However, we believe the opportunity is differentiated and justifies the price."

**Outline**:
- Valuation methodologies: Comps, precedents, DCF (0:00–4:00)
- Benchmarking entry valuation and justifying premiums (4:00–10:00)
- Exit multiple assumptions: Conservative vs. aggressive (10:00–14:00)
- Returns attribution: MOIC and IRR drivers (14:00–18:00)
- Base, upside, downside scenarios (18:00–22:00)
- Defending valuation when IC challenges price (22:00–25:00)

**Suggested Length**: 25 minutes

## Key Takeaways

- Valuation in PE anchors on EBITDA multiples benchmarked against public comps and precedent transactions—justify premiums with differentiation (growth, margins, moat)
- Use conservative exit multiple assumptions (flat or declining) to force value creation through EBITDA growth rather than relying on multiple expansion or arbitrage
- Attribute returns to specific drivers (EBITDA growth, multiple expansion, debt paydown) with >70% from operational improvements and <30% from multiple or leverage
- Present three scenarios (base, upside, downside) showing returns under different assumptions—IC assesses whether base is achievable and downside meets hurdles
- Defend valuation with data (EV/Revenue, growth vs. comps, precedent transactions) and strategic rationale (platform value, buy-and-build, professionalization)
- If valuation cannot be defended, acknowledge it and offer to walk or renegotiate—do not force-fit justifications that IC will reject
