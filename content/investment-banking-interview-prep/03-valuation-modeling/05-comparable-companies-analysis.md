# Comparable Companies Analysis

## Learning Objectives

- Explain the purpose and methodology of comparable company analysis (comps)
- Identify appropriate comparable companies based on industry, size, and business model
- Calculate and interpret key valuation multiples (EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA, P/E)
- Understand the advantages and limitations of using comps for valuation

## Written Guide

### What Is Comparable Company Analysis?

**Comparable company analysis (comps)** is a relative valuation method that values a company by comparing it to similar publicly traded companies. The logic is simple: similar companies should trade at similar multiples.

Comps are market-based, fast, and easy to understand, which makes them widely used in investment banking for valuation ranges, pitch books, and fairness opinions.

### The Comps Methodology

The process follows these steps:

1. **Select comparable companies**: Identify publicly traded companies similar to the target in terms of industry, size, growth, and business model.
2. **Gather financial data**: Collect revenue, EBITDA, net income, and other metrics for each comp.
3. **Calculate trading multiples**: Compute key multiples like EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA, and P/E for each comp.
4. **Determine a valuation range**: Apply the median or mean multiple from the comps to the target company's metrics to estimate its value.

### Step 1: Selecting Comparable Companies

The quality of a comps analysis depends on selecting truly comparable companies. Key criteria:

**Industry and Business Model**:
- Companies should operate in the same or adjacent industries
- Business models should be similar (e.g., SaaS vs. hardware, retail vs. e-commerce)

**Size (Revenue, Market Cap)**:
- Compare companies of similar scale. A $50B company may trade differently than a $500M company due to liquidity, diversification, or market perception.

**Geography**:
- Companies in the same region or with similar geographic exposure trade more comparably

**Growth and Profitability**:
- High-growth companies trade at higher multiples than mature, low-growth companies
- Profitable companies trade differently than unprofitable ones

**Other Factors**:
- Public vs. private (comps must be public)
- Diversified conglomerates vs. pure-plays

The goal is to select 5-10 companies that are reasonably similar. Perfect comps rarely exist.

### Step 2: Gather Financial Data

For each comparable company, gather:

- **Market data**: Stock price, shares outstanding, market cap
- **Balance sheet data**: Debt, cash, preferred stock (to calculate EV)
- **Income statement data**: Revenue, EBITDA, EBIT, net income
- **Metrics**: LTM (last twelve months) or NTM (next twelve months, based on estimates)

This data is typically pulled from Bloomberg, FactSet, CapIQ, or public filings (10-Ks, 10-Qs).

### Step 3: Calculate Key Multiples

The most common multiples used in comps are:

**EV / Revenue**:
- Used for high-growth or early-stage companies that may not be profitable
- Common in tech, SaaS, biotech

**EV / EBITDA**:
- The most widely used multiple across industries
- Reflects operating profitability and is capital-structure neutral

**EV / EBIT**:
- Similar to EV/EBITDA but includes D&A
- Used when D&A is a significant operating cost

**P / E (Price-to-Earnings)**:
- Equity multiple; used for mature, profitable companies
- Common in financials, industrials, consumer goods

**P / B (Price-to-Book)**:
- Equity multiple; used for asset-heavy companies or financials

For enterprise value multiples (EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA), calculate EV for each comp:

EV = Market Cap + Net Debt

Then divide EV by the relevant metric (Revenue, EBITDA).

### Step 4: Determine Valuation Range

Once you have multiples for all comps, calculate summary statistics:

- **Median**: Often preferred because it's less affected by outliers
- **Mean (Average)**: Can be skewed by extreme values
- **25th and 75th Percentiles**: Provides a range

**Example**:

Comps have the following EV/EBITDA multiples: 8.0×, 9.5×, 10.0×, 10.5×, 12.0×

- Median = 10.0×
- Mean = 10.0×
- Range = 8.0× to 12.0×

If the target company has EBITDA of $100M, the implied EV range is:

- Low: $100M × 8.0 = $800M
- Median: $100M × 10.0 = $1,000M
- High: $100M × 12.0 = $1,200M

You would then subtract net debt to arrive at equity value.

### Advantages of Comps

- **Market-based**: Reflects what investors are currently willing to pay
- **Simple and intuitive**: Easy to calculate and explain
- **Fast**: Can be done quickly with publicly available data

### Limitations of Comps

- **No two companies are identical**: Even "comparable" companies differ in growth, margins, risk, and management quality
- **Market sentiment**: Comps reflect current market conditions, which can be irrational or cyclical
- **Data availability**: Private companies or unique businesses may lack good comps
- **Multiples can be misleading**: A low P/E might indicate value or risk; context matters

### Common Mistakes

**Choosing poor comps**: Including companies that are too different in size, geography, or business model undermines the analysis.

**Using the wrong multiple**: Don't use EV/EBITDA for an unprofitable company with negative EBITDA. Use EV/Revenue instead.

**Not adjusting for one-time items**: If a comp has a one-time gain or loss, adjust EBITDA or net income to reflect normalized performance.

**Relying on comps alone**: Comps should be one of several valuation methods. Cross-check with DCF and precedent transactions.

## Key Takeaways

- Comps value a company based on how similar companies are trading in the public markets
- Select 5-10 comparable companies based on industry, size, growth, and business model
- Common multiples: EV/Revenue (growth cos), EV/EBITDA (most common), EV/EBIT, P/E
- Apply the median or range of multiples to the target's metrics to estimate value
- Comps are fast, market-based, and intuitive, but no two companies are identical
- Use comps as one of several valuation methods, not in isolation
