# M&A Accretion/Dilution Analysis

## Learning Objectives

- Explain what accretion and dilution mean in the context of an M&A transaction
- Calculate pro forma EPS to determine whether a deal is accretive or dilutive
- Understand the factors that drive accretion or dilution (P/E, cost of financing, synergies)
- Answer interview questions involving accretion/dilution scenarios

## Written Guide

### What Is Accretion/Dilution?

In an M&A transaction, **accretion** and **dilution** refer to the impact of the deal on the acquirer's **earnings per share (EPS)**.

- **Accretive**: The deal increases the acquirer's EPS
- **Dilutive**: The deal decreases the acquirer's EPS
- **Neutral**: EPS remains unchanged

Accretion/dilution analysis is a key output in merger models and is often a factor in whether a deal is attractive to the acquirer's shareholders.

### Why Accretion/Dilution Matters

Acquirer management and boards care about EPS because:

- **Stock price sensitivity**: EPS is a key driver of stock prices (through P/E multiples)
- **Shareholder perception**: Dilutive deals can be unpopular with investors, even if they create long-term value
- **Executive compensation**: Management incentives are often tied to EPS targets

However, **accretion/dilution is not the same as value creation**. A deal can be accretive but destroy value (e.g., overpaying for a target), or dilutive but create value (e.g., a strategic acquisition that pays off over time).

### The Accretion/Dilution Framework

To determine whether a deal is accretive or dilutive:

1. **Calculate the acquirer's standalone EPS** (without the deal)
2. **Calculate the target's earnings contribution** (net income the acquirer will gain)
3. **Account for the cost of the acquisition** (interest on debt or dilution from issuing stock)
4. **Calculate pro forma EPS** (combined company EPS after the deal)
5. **Compare**: If pro forma EPS > standalone EPS, the deal is accretive. If pro forma EPS < standalone EPS, it's dilutive.

### Step-by-Step Example: All-Cash Deal

**Acquirer**:
- Net income: $100M
- Shares outstanding: 50M
- EPS: $100M / 50M = $2.00

**Target**:
- Net income: $20M
- Purchase price: $300M (all cash, financed with debt at 5% interest)

**Step 1: Standalone EPS**

Acquirer EPS = $2.00

**Step 2: Target's earnings contribution**

Target contributes $20M in net income.

**Step 3: Cost of acquisition**

Interest expense on $300M debt at 5% = $15M/year

After-tax interest expense (assume 25% tax rate) = $15M × (1 - 0.25) = $11.25M

**Step 4: Pro forma net income**

Pro Forma Net Income = Acquirer NI + Target NI - After-Tax Interest

= $100M + $20M - $11.25M = $108.75M

**Step 5: Pro forma EPS**

Shares outstanding remain 50M (no new shares issued in a cash deal).

Pro Forma EPS = $108.75M / 50M = $2.175

**Accretion/Dilution**:

Pro Forma EPS ($2.175) > Standalone EPS ($2.00)

The deal is **accretive by $0.175 per share**, or 8.75%.

### Step-by-Step Example: All-Stock Deal

**Acquirer**:
- Net income: $100M
- Shares outstanding: 50M
- Stock price: $40
- EPS: $2.00

**Target**:
- Net income: $20M
- Purchase price: $300M (all stock)

**Step 1: Calculate shares issued**

Shares issued = Purchase Price / Acquirer Stock Price = $300M / $40 = 7.5M shares

**Step 2: Pro forma net income**

No debt is issued, so no interest expense.

Pro Forma Net Income = $100M + $20M = $120M

**Step 3: Pro forma shares outstanding**

Pro Forma Shares = 50M + 7.5M = 57.5M

**Step 4: Pro forma EPS**

Pro Forma EPS = $120M / 57.5M = $2.087

**Accretion/Dilution**:

Pro Forma EPS ($2.087) > Standalone EPS ($2.00)

The deal is **accretive by $0.087 per share**, or 4.35%.

### What Drives Accretion or Dilution?

**P/E Ratio Comparison**:

If the acquirer's P/E ratio is **higher** than the target's P/E ratio, the deal is more likely to be accretive (the acquirer is using "expensive" stock to buy "cheap" earnings).

If the acquirer's P/E is **lower** than the target's, the deal is more likely to be dilutive.

**Cost of Financing**:

- **Cash (debt-financed)**: The cost is the after-tax interest rate. If the target's earnings yield exceeds the after-tax cost of debt, the deal is likely accretive.
- **Stock**: The cost is the dilution from issuing new shares. If the acquirer's P/E is high, stock is "cheaper" (less dilution per dollar).

**Synergies**:

Cost synergies (reducing combined expenses) or revenue synergies (increasing combined revenue) improve pro forma earnings and increase accretion.

### Interview Question: "Is a Deal More Likely to Be Accretive with Cash or Stock?"

The answer depends on the **cost of financing**:

- **Cash (debt)**: If the acquirer can borrow at a low after-tax rate (e.g., 4%) and the target's earnings yield is higher, cash is more accretive.
- **Stock**: If the acquirer's P/E is very high (stock is "expensive"), using stock can be more accretive because less dilution is required.

**General rule**: If the acquirer's P/E > target's P/E, stock is likely more accretive. If the after-tax cost of debt < target's earnings yield, cash is likely more accretive.

### Common Mistakes

**Confusing accretion with value creation**: A deal can be accretive due to financial engineering (low cost of debt, high P/E) but still overpay for the target and destroy value.

**Forgetting the tax shield on interest**: Interest expense reduces taxes, so the effective cost is after-tax.

**Not accounting for synergies**: Synergies improve pro forma earnings and make deals more accretive.

**Using the wrong share count**: In a stock deal, the acquirer's share count increases by the shares issued to the target's shareholders.

## Key Takeaways

- Accretion/dilution measures the impact of an M&A deal on the acquirer's EPS
- Accretive = pro forma EPS > standalone EPS; Dilutive = pro forma EPS < standalone EPS
- In a cash deal, account for after-tax interest expense on debt
- In a stock deal, account for dilution from new shares issued
- If acquirer's P/E > target's P/E, the deal is more likely to be accretive
- Accretion ≠ value creation; a deal can be accretive but still overpay
