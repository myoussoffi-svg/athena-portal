## Written Guide

### Why the Balance Sheet Matters in Interviews

The balance sheet is essential for understanding a company's financial position, calculating enterprise value, and analyzing leverage. Interviewers will test your knowledge of balance sheet structure, your ability to interpret line items, and your understanding of how transactions flow through the balance sheet.

You also need to be fluent with concepts like working capital, net debt, and the distinction between enterprise value and equity value—all of which rely on the balance sheet.

### Structure of the Balance Sheet

The balance sheet is organized into three sections: assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity. It follows the fundamental accounting equation:

**Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity**

This equation must always hold. The balance sheet is a snapshot at a specific point in time (e.g., end of quarter or year).

### Assets

Assets are what the company owns or controls. They're divided into current and non-current.

**Current Assets** (expected to be converted to cash or used within one year):
- **Cash and Cash Equivalents**: Liquid assets, including bank deposits and short-term investments
- **Accounts Receivable**: Money owed by customers for goods or services sold on credit
- **Inventory**: Goods available for sale or raw materials for production
- **Prepaid Expenses**: Payments made in advance (e.g., insurance, rent)

**Non-Current Assets** (long-term assets):
- **Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E)**: Physical assets like buildings, machinery, and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation
- **Intangible Assets**: Non-physical assets like patents, trademarks, and customer relationships
- **Goodwill**: The premium paid in an acquisition above the fair value of net assets acquired
- **Long-term Investments**: Equity stakes in other companies or long-term securities

**Total Assets** = Current Assets + Non-Current Assets

### Liabilities

Liabilities are what the company owes. Like assets, they're divided into current and non-current.

**Current Liabilities** (due within one year):
- **Accounts Payable**: Money owed to suppliers for goods or services purchased on credit
- **Accrued Expenses**: Expenses incurred but not yet paid (e.g., wages, utilities)
- **Short-term Debt**: Debt due within one year, including the current portion of long-term debt
- **Deferred Revenue**: Cash received for goods or services not yet delivered

**Non-Current Liabilities** (long-term obligations):
- **Long-term Debt**: Debt with maturities beyond one year
- **Deferred Tax Liabilities**: Taxes owed in the future due to timing differences in accounting vs. tax treatment
- **Pension Liabilities and Other Long-term Obligations**

**Total Liabilities** = Current Liabilities + Non-Current Liabilities

### Shareholders' Equity

Shareholders' equity is the residual value that belongs to owners after liabilities are subtracted from assets. It includes:

- **Common Stock**: Par value of shares issued
- **Additional Paid-In Capital (APIC)**: Amount received from shareholders above par value
- **Retained Earnings**: Cumulative net income minus dividends paid over the company's history
- **Treasury Stock**: Shares repurchased by the company (reduces equity)
- **Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI)**: Gains or losses not yet realized (e.g., foreign currency translation)

**Total Equity** = Common Stock + APIC + Retained Earnings - Treasury Stock + AOCI

The balance sheet equation:

**Assets = Liabilities + Equity**

### Working Capital

**Net Working Capital (NWC)** is a measure of short-term liquidity:

NWC = Current Assets - Current Liabilities

Or, more specifically for modeling purposes:

NWC = (Accounts Receivable + Inventory) - Accounts Payable

Working capital represents the cash tied up in day-to-day operations. An increase in working capital is a use of cash; a decrease is a source of cash.

### Net Debt and Enterprise Value

**Net Debt** is a key metric derived from the balance sheet:

Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash and Cash Equivalents

Where **Total Debt** = Short-term Debt + Long-term Debt

**Enterprise Value (EV)** represents the total value of a company's operations and is calculated as:

EV = Equity Value (Market Cap) + Net Debt + Preferred Stock + Minority Interest - Investments in Affiliates

Net debt is added because when you acquire a company, you assume its debt and receive its cash.

### How Transactions Affect the Balance Sheet

Every transaction must keep the balance sheet in balance. For example:

**Company issues $100 of debt**:
- Cash (asset) increases by $100
- Debt (liability) increases by $100
- Balance: +$100 assets = +$100 liabilities

**Company pays $50 dividend**:
- Cash (asset) decreases by $50
- Retained earnings (equity) decrease by $50
- Balance: -$50 assets = -$50 equity

**Company buys $80 of inventory with cash**:
- Cash (asset) decreases by $80
- Inventory (asset) increases by $80
- Balance: -$80 cash + $80 inventory = 0 net change

If the balance sheet doesn't balance, you've made an error.

### Common Mistakes

**Confusing book value with market value**: The balance sheet shows book values (historical cost less depreciation). Market values (e.g., stock price) aren't on the balance sheet.

**Forgetting that the balance sheet is cumulative**: Unlike the income statement, which resets each period, the balance sheet reflects everything since the company's inception.

**Not understanding net working capital**: NWC is critical for cash flow modeling. Increases in NWC are a use of cash.

**Ignoring the distinction between current and non-current**: Current items are short-term (within one year); non-current are long-term. This matters for liquidity analysis.

## Key Takeaways

- The balance sheet shows a company's financial position at a point in time: assets, liabilities, and equity
- The fundamental equation: Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity must always hold
- Current assets and liabilities are short-term (within one year); non-current are long-term
- Net working capital (NWC) = Current Assets - Current Liabilities; changes in NWC affect cash flow
- Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash; used to calculate enterprise value
- Every transaction must keep the balance sheet balanced
