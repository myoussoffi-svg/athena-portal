# Goodwill, Intangibles, and Writedowns

## Learning Objectives

- Explain what goodwill is, how it's created, and why it appears on the balance sheet
- Distinguish between goodwill and other intangible assets
- Understand how impairment and writedowns affect the three financial statements
- Answer interview questions involving M&A transactions and the treatment of goodwill

## Written Guide

### What Is Goodwill?

**Goodwill** is an intangible asset that arises when one company acquires another for more than the fair value of its identifiable net assets. It represents the premium paid for factors like brand value, customer relationships, employee talent, or synergies.

**Formula**:

Goodwill = Purchase Price - Fair Value of Net Assets Acquired

Where **Net Assets** = Assets - Liabilities

**Example**:
Company A acquires Company B for $500 million. Company B's identifiable assets (inventory, PP&E, intangibles) are worth $400 million, and its liabilities are $150 million.

Fair Value of Net Assets = $400M - $150M = $250M

Goodwill = $500M - $250M = $250M

The $250 million premium is recorded as goodwill on Company A's balance sheet.

### Goodwill vs. Other Intangible Assets

**Intangible Assets** are non-physical assets with economic value. They include:

- **Identifiable intangibles**: Patents, trademarks, customer lists, technology, trade names
- **Goodwill**: The residual premium that can't be attributed to specific identifiable assets

The key difference:

- **Identifiable intangibles** have finite useful lives and are **amortized** over time (e.g., a patent might be amortized over 10 years)
- **Goodwill** has an indefinite life and **isn't amortized** under U.S. GAAP (since 2001). Instead, it's tested annually for **impairment**.

### How Goodwill Is Created in an Acquisition

When Company A acquires Company B:

1. **Purchase Price Allocation (PPA)**: The purchase price is allocated first to identifiable assets (inventory, PP&E, intangibles) and liabilities at fair value.
2. **Residual = Goodwill**: Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets is recorded as goodwill.

**Balance Sheet Impact**:
- **Assets**: Goodwill and other acquired assets increase
- **Liabilities**: Assumed liabilities increase
- **Equity or Cash**: Decreases (if paid in cash) or increases (if paid in stock)

Goodwill sits on the balance sheet and doesn't get amortized. It remains there unless it's impaired.

### Goodwill Impairment

Goodwill must be tested for **impairment** annually (or more frequently if there are signs of trouble). Impairment occurs when the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value, meaning the acquired business is no longer worth what was paid.

**When does impairment happen?**
- The acquired business underperforms
- Market conditions deteriorate
- Synergies don't materialize

**Impact of Impairment**:

If goodwill is impaired (e.g., written down by $100 million):

**Income Statement**:
- Impairment charge of $100M appears as an expense, reducing EBIT and net income
- This is a non-cash charge (no cash leaves the company)

**Balance Sheet**:
- Goodwill (asset) decreases by $100M
- Retained earnings (equity) decrease by $100M (or less after tax, though goodwill impairments are often not tax-deductible)
- Balance sheet balances: -$100M assets = -$100M equity

**Cash Flow Statement**:
- Net income decreases by $100M
- Impairment is a non-cash charge, so it's added back in CFO
- No impact on cash

### Amortization of Intangible Assets (Not Goodwill)

Identifiable intangibles like patents or customer relationships are amortized over their useful life.

**Example**: A company acquires a patent worth $50M with a 10-year useful life.

- Annual amortization = $50M / 10 = $5M/year
- This $5M is a non-cash expense that reduces EBIT and net income
- It's added back in the cash flow statement (like depreciation)
- The book value of the intangible asset declines by $5M/year on the balance sheet

### Interview Question: "Company A Buys Company B for $300M in Cash. Company B Has $200M in Assets and $100M in Liabilities. Walk Me Through the Impact."

**Purchase Price**: $300M cash

**Fair Value of Net Assets**: $200M assets - $100M liabilities = $100M

**Goodwill**: $300M - $100M = $200M

**Income Statement**:
- No immediate impact (goodwill isn't amortized)

**Balance Sheet** (for Company A):
- Cash decreases by $300M (asset)
- Assets increase by $200M (acquired assets)
- Goodwill increases by $200M (asset)
- Liabilities increase by $100M (assumed liabilities)

Check the balance:
- Assets: -$300M cash + $200M acquired assets + $200M goodwill = +$100M
- Liabilities: +$100M
- Equity: No change
- Balance: +$100M assets = +$100M liabilities

**Cash Flow Statement**:
- Cash outflow of $300M in CFI (acquisition)
- Net change in cash: -$300M

### Common Mistakes

**Thinking goodwill is amortized**: Under U.S. GAAP, goodwill isn't amortized (though it is under some international standards like IFRS, where it may be amortized in certain cases). It's tested for impairment.

**Confusing goodwill with other intangibles**: Identifiable intangibles (patents, trademarks) are amortized. Goodwill isn't.

**Forgetting that impairment is non-cash**: Goodwill impairment reduces net income and the book value of assets, but it doesn't affect cash flow.

**Not allocating purchase price correctly in M&A questions**: You need to first allocate to identifiable assets and liabilities at fair value, then the residual is goodwill.

## Key Takeaways

- Goodwill = Purchase Price - Fair Value of Net Assets Acquired
- Goodwill arises in M&A when a buyer pays more than the fair value of identifiable net assets
- Goodwill isn't amortized; it's tested annually for impairment
- Identifiable intangibles (patents, trademarks) are amortized over their useful life
- Goodwill impairment is a non-cash charge that reduces net income and book value but not cash flow
- In M&A questions, allocate the purchase price to identifiable assets and liabilities first, then record the residual as goodwill
