## Written Guide

### The Goal of Forecasting

Forecasting isn't about predicting the future perfectly—it's about building a reasonable base case and understanding how changes in assumptions affect outcomes. A good forecast is:

- **Grounded in historical performance**: Past results inform future expectations
- **Consistent with industry dynamics**: Growth rates and margins should make sense for the sector
- **Internally coherent**: Revenue, costs, and capital needs should relate logically

### Revenue Forecasting Approaches

**Top-Down Forecasting**

Start with the overall market and work down to the company:

1. Estimate total addressable market (TAM) size
2. Project market growth rate
3. Estimate the company's market share
4. Calculate revenue as: Market Size × Market Share

This approach works well for companies in defined markets where industry data is available.

**Bottom-Up Forecasting**

Build revenue from operational drivers:

- **Volume × Price**: Units sold × average selling price
- **Customers × Revenue per Customer**: User count × ARPU (average revenue per user)
- **Capacity × Utilization × Rate**: For asset-heavy businesses like airlines or hotels

Bottom-up is more granular and often more accurate, but requires operational data.

**Growth Rate Approach**

The simplest method: apply a growth rate to prior-year revenue.

Revenue(Year N) = Revenue(Year N-1) × (1 + Growth Rate)

This works for mature, stable businesses. The key is selecting appropriate growth rates based on:

- Historical growth trends
- Management guidance
- Industry growth expectations
- Competitive dynamics

### Building the Revenue Forecast

**Step 1: Analyze Historical Revenue**

Look at 3-5 years of history:

- What's the compound annual growth rate (CAGR)?
- Is growth accelerating, stable, or decelerating?
- Are there one-time items affecting comparability?
- How does growth compare to industry peers?

**Step 2: Segment Revenue (if applicable)**

Many companies report revenue by:

- Product line
- Geography
- Customer type
- Business segment

Forecast each segment separately, then sum to total. Different segments often have different growth profiles.

**Step 3: Select Drivers and Assumptions**

For each segment or the total, decide:

- What drives revenue? (price, volume, market share, etc.)
- What growth rate is appropriate for each forecast year?
- Should growth rates change over time? (e.g., decelerate as company matures)

**Step 4: Build the Projection**

Create a row for each revenue line item. Apply growth rates or driver calculations to project each year.

**Example**:

| | Year 1 (Actual) | Year 2 (Actual) | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Revenue Growth | — | 8.0% | 6.0% | 5.0% | 4.0% |
| Revenue | $500M | $540M | $572M | $601M | $625M |

Notice growth decelerates over time—common for maturing businesses.

### Cost Forecasting: Fixed vs. Variable

Understanding cost behavior is essential for projecting expenses:

**Variable Costs**: Scale with revenue
- Cost of goods sold (COGS)
- Sales commissions
- Shipping and fulfillment

Project as a percentage of revenue (gross margin assumption).

**Fixed Costs**: Don't change with revenue (in the short term)
- Rent
- Base salaries
- Insurance

Project as flat amounts or with inflation adjustments.

**Semi-Variable Costs**: Have both fixed and variable components
- Utilities (base charge + usage)
- Labor (base staff + overtime)

Project with a fixed base plus a variable component.

### Building the Cost Forecast

**Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**

COGS represents the direct costs of producing goods or delivering services. Project using gross margin:

COGS = Revenue × (1 - Gross Margin %)

Or equivalently:

Gross Profit = Revenue × Gross Margin %
COGS = Revenue - Gross Profit

**Historical Analysis**: Look at gross margin trends. Is the company gaining efficiency (margin expanding) or facing cost pressures (margin contracting)?

**Projection Approach**: Often hold gross margin constant or adjust slightly based on expected trends.

| | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Revenue | $500M | $540M | $572M | $601M | $625M |
| Gross Margin | 40.0% | 40.5% | 41.0% | 41.0% | 41.0% |
| Gross Profit | $200M | $219M | $235M | $246M | $256M |
| COGS | $300M | $321M | $338M | $355M | $369M |

**Operating Expenses (OpEx)**

Operating expenses include SG&A (selling, general & administrative), R&D, and other operating costs. Common projection methods:

1. **Percentage of Revenue**: Assume OpEx grows proportionally with revenue
2. **Fixed + Variable**: Separate fixed costs from variable costs
3. **Line-by-Line**: Forecast each expense category individually

**Operating Leverage**: As revenue grows, fixed costs become a smaller percentage of revenue, expanding operating margins. This is why high-growth companies often show margin expansion.

**Example with Operating Leverage**:

| | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Revenue | $100M | $120M | $140M |
| Fixed Costs | $30M | $30M | $30M |
| Variable Costs (20% of Rev) | $20M | $24M | $28M |
| Total OpEx | $50M | $54M | $58M |
| OpEx as % of Revenue | 50.0% | 45.0% | 41.4% |

The OpEx percentage declines as revenue scales over the fixed cost base.

### From Gross Profit to EBIT

The income statement flows:

```
Revenue
- COGS
= Gross Profit
- SG&A
- R&D
- Other Operating Expenses
= EBIT (Operating Income)
```

**EBIT Margin** = EBIT / Revenue

EBIT margin combines gross margin and operating efficiency. It's a key metric for comparing profitability across companies (since it's before interest and taxes).

### Below EBIT: Interest, Taxes, Net Income

**Interest Expense**: Calculated from debt balances (covered in later lesson on debt schedules). For initial projections, you can estimate based on average debt and interest rate.

**Interest Income**: Calculated from cash balances and assumed interest rate on cash.

**Pre-Tax Income** = EBIT - Interest Expense + Interest Income

**Tax Expense**: Apply the effective tax rate to pre-tax income.

Tax Expense = Pre-Tax Income × Tax Rate

Use the statutory rate (e.g., 21% federal + state in the US) or the company's historical effective rate.

**Net Income** = Pre-Tax Income - Tax Expense

### Putting It All Together: Projected Income Statement

| | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Revenue** | $500M | $540M | $572M | $601M | $625M |
| Growth % | — | 8.0% | 6.0% | 5.0% | 4.0% |
| **COGS** | $300M | $321M | $338M | $355M | $369M |
| Gross Margin | 40.0% | 40.5% | 41.0% | 41.0% | 41.0% |
| **Gross Profit** | $200M | $219M | $235M | $246M | $256M |
| **SG&A** | $100M | $105M | $109M | $113M | $116M |
| % of Revenue | 20.0% | 19.4% | 19.1% | 18.8% | 18.6% |
| **EBIT** | $100M | $114M | $126M | $133M | $140M |
| EBIT Margin | 20.0% | 21.1% | 22.0% | 22.1% | 22.4% |
| **Interest Expense** | ($10M) | ($10M) | ($9M) | ($8M) | ($7M) |
| **Pre-Tax Income** | $90M | $104M | $117M | $125M | $133M |
| **Tax Expense** | ($23M) | ($26M) | ($29M) | ($31M) | ($33M) |
| Tax Rate | 25.0% | 25.0% | 25.0% | 25.0% | 25.0% |
| **Net Income** | $68M | $78M | $88M | $94M | $100M |

### Common Forecasting Mistakes

**Straight-lining everything**: Real businesses don't grow at exactly the same rate forever. Build in deceleration for maturing businesses or acceleration for turnarounds.

**Ignoring operating leverage**: If you project costs as a flat percentage of revenue, you miss the margin expansion that comes from fixed cost leverage.

**Unrealistic margin assumptions**: Compare your projected margins to historical results and peer companies. If your Year 5 EBIT margin is 10 points higher than any competitor, revisit your assumptions.

**Forgetting to stress test**: What happens if revenue growth is 2% instead of 6%? What if gross margin compresses 200 basis points? Run sensitivities to understand risk.

## Key Takeaways

- Revenue can be forecast top-down (market × share), bottom-up (drivers), or via growth rates
- Analyze 3-5 years of history to understand trends before projecting
- Variable costs scale with revenue; fixed costs create operating leverage as revenue grows
- Project COGS using gross margin assumptions; project OpEx with fixed + variable components
- EBIT margin typically expands as companies scale (operating leverage)
- Interest expense links to debt balances; tax expense uses effective or statutory rate
- Stress test your projections—small changes in assumptions can significantly affect outcomes
