# Strengths, Weaknesses, and Behavioral Questions

## Learning Objectives

- Explain your strengths in a way that is credible, specific, and relevant to investment banking
- Discuss weaknesses honestly while demonstrating self-awareness and a plan for improvement
- Structure responses to behavioral questions using a clear framework
- Anticipate follow-up questions that probe for depth and authenticity

## Written Guide

### Why Behavioral Questions Matter

Behavioral questions assess how you think, how you handle situations, and whether you have the judgment and self-awareness required for a high-pressure role. Interviewers are looking for patterns: Do you take ownership of mistakes? Do you work well under pressure? Can you handle feedback?

Strong candidates provide specific examples and demonstrate reflection. Weak candidates give generic answers or fail to show what they learned.

### Strengths: How to Answer Credibly

"What are your strengths?" is not an invitation to list adjectives. Interviewers want to understand what you're genuinely good at and how that applies to banking.

A strong answer includes:

1. **The strength**: Be specific (e.g., "attention to detail," "ability to work under tight deadlines")
2. **Evidence**: Provide a concrete example from school, work, or extracurriculars
3. **Relevance**: Explain why this strength matters in banking

For example:

"One of my strengths is attention to detail. In my last internship, I was responsible for updating financial models and preparing client presentations. I built a habit of triple-checking numbers and formatting before submitting anything, which helped me catch errors before they reached senior bankers. In banking, where small mistakes can have big consequences, I think that discipline is critical."

This is credible because it's specific, supported by evidence, and tied to the job.

Avoid:

- Generic strengths with no examples ("I'm a hard worker")
- Strengths that don't matter in banking ("I'm very creative")
- Overstating ("I'm the best analyst you'll ever hire")

### Weaknesses: Demonstrating Self-Awareness

"What is your greatest weakness?" is a test of honesty and self-awareness. Interviewers know you're not perfect. They want to see that you recognize your limitations and are working to improve.

A strong answer follows this structure:

1. **The weakness**: Be honest, but choose something real and manageable
2. **Context**: Explain when or how this has been a challenge
3. **What you're doing about it**: Show that you're actively addressing it

For example:

"Early in my career, I struggled with delegating tasks. I would often take on too much myself rather than asking for help, which sometimes led to inefficiencies. I've been working on this by being more proactive about communicating when I'm overloaded and by trusting teammates to handle parts of a project. It's still something I'm developing, but I've seen improvement."

This works because it's honest, specific, and shows growth.

Avoid:

- Fake weaknesses ("I'm a perfectionist" or "I work too hard")
- Weaknesses that are disqualifying ("I'm bad with numbers" or "I don't handle pressure well")
- Weaknesses with no plan for improvement

### Behavioral Questions: The STAR Framework

Behavioral questions typically follow the format: "Tell me about a time when..." or "Describe a situation where..."

Common examples:

- "Tell me about a time you worked on a team and had a conflict."
- "Describe a situation where you had to meet a tight deadline."
- "Tell me about a time you failed."

The STAR framework helps structure your response:

- **Situation**: Set the context (what was happening, where, when)
- **Task**: Explain what you were responsible for or what the challenge was
- **Action**: Describe what you specifically did
- **Result**: Explain the outcome and what you learned

**Example**:

"Tell me about a time you had to manage a difficult teammate."

**Situation**: "During a group project in my finance class, one team member was consistently missing deadlines."

**Task**: "As the project lead, I needed to ensure we delivered on time without alienating the team member."

**Action**: "I scheduled a one-on-one conversation to understand what was going on. It turned out they were struggling with another course and felt overwhelmed. We redistributed some of the work and set more frequent check-ins."

**Result**: "We finished the project on time, and the team member contributed effectively once we adjusted the approach. I learned that addressing issues directly and with empathy is usually more effective than letting frustration build."

This answer is specific, demonstrates leadership and judgment, and shows learning.

### Common Behavioral Question Archetypes

Prepare examples for these common categories:

- **Teamwork and conflict**: "Tell me about a time you disagreed with a teammate."
- **Leadership**: "Describe a time you led a project or initiative."
- **Failure or setback**: "Tell me about a time you failed."
- **Handling pressure**: "Describe a time you had to meet a tight deadline."
- **Taking initiative**: "Tell me about a time you went above and beyond."

You should have 3-5 strong examples that you can adapt to different questions.

### Common Mistakes

**Being vague**: "I worked hard and it turned out fine" is not a story. Provide specifics.

**Not taking ownership**: If the question is about failure, admit the mistake and explain what you learned. Blaming others is a red flag.

**Rambling**: Behavioral questions should take 60-90 seconds to answer. Practice keeping responses concise.

**Using hypotheticals**: If asked about a time you did something, use a real example. Saying "I would do X" instead of "I did X" suggests you haven't encountered the situation.
