# Why This Firm

## Learning Objectives

- Explain why you're interested in a specific bank in a way that shows research and genuine fit
- Differentiate your answer across firms when interviewing at multiple banks
- Avoid generic or superficial responses that apply to any bulge bracket or elite boutique
- Prepare for follow-up questions that test the depth and sincerity of your interest

## Written Guide

### Why This Question Matters

"Why this firm?" is a test of preparation and sincerity. Interviewers want to know whether you've done your research, whether you understand what makes their bank distinct, and whether you're genuinely interested or just applying everywhere.

A strong answer shows that you've thought carefully about fit. A weak answer sounds like it could be copied and pasted into any interview.

### What Makes a Strong "Why This Firm" Answer

Effective answers reference specific, verifiable attributes of the firm that align with your interests or goals. These might include:

**Culture or working style**: Some banks emphasize collaboration and mentorship; others are known for high autonomy or intensity. If you've spoken with current or former employees and have a perspective on the culture, reference it.

**Deal focus or sector strength**: If the firm is known for a specific industry (e.g., TMT, healthcare, energy) or deal type (e.g., M&A, restructuring), and that aligns with your interest, say so.

**Geographic presence or client base**: If you're interested in international deals or working with a certain client segment (e.g., sponsor coverage, corporate clients), and the firm has a strong presence there, that's relevant.

**Training or development programs**: Some banks have formal analyst training programs or rotations. If that appeals to you, mention it—but only if you've researched what those programs involve.

**Conversations with employees**: If you've spoken with analysts or associates and came away impressed by their experiences, reference those conversations specifically. This is credible and shows initiative.

### What Makes a Weak Answer

Generic statements that could apply to any bank are weak. Examples include:

- "You're a top-tier bank" (Every bulge bracket says this about itself)
- "You work on the best deals" (Subjective and unverifiable)
- "I've always wanted to work here" (Unclear why)
- "Your culture is great" (Based on what?)

These answers signal that you haven't done meaningful research or that you're applying indiscriminately.

### Differentiating Across Firms

If you're interviewing at multiple banks, you need different answers for each. Interviewers know you're recruiting broadly, but they want to believe you've thought specifically about their firm.

To differentiate:

- Research recent deals the bank has worked on and reference them if relevant
- Speak with analysts or associates at each bank and ask about their experiences
- Identify 1-2 attributes that distinguish each firm (sector strength, culture, training, deal flow)
- Tailor your answer to emphasize why those attributes matter to you

Avoid recycling the same answer across firms. Interviewers compare notes, and a generic answer is obvious.

### Handling Follow-Up Questions

Interviewers will test your answer. If you mention culture, expect: "What specifically did you learn about our culture?" If you mention a sector, expect: "Why that sector?"

Your answer should be detailed enough to withstand these probes. If you can't elaborate, don't make the claim.

Other common follow-ups:

- "Who have you spoken with here?"
- "What other banks are you recruiting for, and why?"
- "If you got offers from us and [competitor], how would you decide?"

Be prepared to answer honestly. Saying "I'm only recruiting for your bank" usually isn't credible unless you have a very specific reason.

### Common Mistakes

**Being too flattering**: Excessive praise ("You're the best bank in the world") sounds insincere. Be specific and balanced.

**Claiming exclusive interest when it's not true**: If you're recruiting broadly, don't pretend otherwise. Interviewers respect honesty.

**Failing to do basic research**: If you claim to be interested in the firm's healthcare practice, but the bank doesn't have a strong healthcare group, that's disqualifying.

**Not speaking with current employees**: The easiest way to develop a credible answer is to speak with analysts or associates. If you haven't, you're at a disadvantage.
