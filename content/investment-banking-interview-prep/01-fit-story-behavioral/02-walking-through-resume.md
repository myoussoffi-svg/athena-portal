# Walking Through Your Resume

## Learning Objectives

- Explain each resume item clearly and concisely when asked to elaborate
- Anticipate which experiences interviewers will probe and prepare detailed responses
- Defend gaps, transitions, or unusual choices on your resume with coherent rationale
- Structure responses to resume questions to emphasize skills relevant to banking

## Written Guide

### Why Interviewers Ask About Your Resume

Your resume is the foundation of the interview. Interviewers use it to assess your experiences, probe for depth, and test how well you can articulate what you've done. They are looking for clarity, ownership, and the ability to connect past work to banking skills.

A resume walkthrough is not a summary. It is an opportunity to demonstrate that you understand what you did, why it mattered, and what you learned. Weak candidates recite bullet points. Strong candidates explain context, decisions, and results.

### How to Structure Responses to "Walk Me Through This Experience"

When asked about a specific role or project, use a clear structure:

1. **Context**: What was the organization, your role, and the objective?
2. **Your contribution**: What did you specifically do? (Avoid "we" unless necessary; focus on "I")
3. **Outcome or learning**: What was the result, or what skill did you develop?

For example, if asked about a finance internship:

"I worked as an analyst intern at [Firm], where I supported the M&A team on two live deals. My role involved building comparable company analyses, updating financial models, and preparing presentation materials for client meetings. One deal closed during my internship, and I learned how to work under tight deadlines and manage multiple requests from senior bankers."

This is clear, specific, and emphasizes relevant skills. It avoids jargon and does not oversell.

### Preparing for Deep Dives

Interviewers will often pick one item from your resume and probe deeply. If you list a financial model you built, expect: "Walk me through the assumptions you used." If you mention a research project, expect: "What was your methodology?"

You should be able to discuss every item on your resume in detail. If you cannot explain something clearly, remove it or be prepared to admit you don't remember the specifics.

Common deep-dive questions:

- "What was the most challenging part of that project?"
- "What would you have done differently?"
- "How did you approach [specific task]?"
- "What did you learn from that experience?"

### Handling Gaps, Transitions, and Red Flags

If your resume includes gaps, role changes, or unconventional experiences, interviewers will ask about them. Do not be defensive. Provide a clear, honest explanation that shows intentionality or learning.

**Gap in employment or academics**: "I took a semester off to work on a family business, where I helped restructure our financial reporting process. It gave me hands-on exposure to financial analysis outside of a classroom setting."

**Switch from non-finance background**: "I studied engineering, but through a summer internship in corporate development, I realized I preferred the deal-focused, client-facing aspects of finance. That's what led me to recruit for banking."

**Unrelated internship or job**: "I worked in marketing for six months after graduation. While I learned a lot about client management, I realized I wanted a more analytical, transaction-focused role, which is why I'm pursuing banking."

The key is to show that your path makes sense and that you've thought critically about your decisions.

### Common Mistakes

**Using vague language**: "I helped the team with various projects" tells an interviewer nothing. Be specific.

**Overstating your role**: If you were an intern who updated a model, do not claim you "led the valuation analysis." Interviewers will catch exaggerations.

**Failing to connect experiences to banking**: If you worked in consulting or operations, explain what transferable skills you developed—analytical thinking, client communication, working under pressure.

**Not preparing for every item on your resume**: If it's on your resume, you must be able to discuss it. If you can't, remove it.
