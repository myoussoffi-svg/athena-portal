# Premiums and Valuation Context

## Learning Objectives

- Explain what a control premium is and why acquirers pay it
- Understand other types of premiums: illiquidity discount, minority discount, strategic premium
- Evaluate how different valuation methods (DCF, comps, precedent transactions) reflect these premiums
- Discuss valuation in context: why different methods yield different ranges and how to reconcile them

## Written Guide

### What Is a Control Premium?

A **control premium** is the additional amount a buyer pays above the current market price to acquire control of a company (typically 100% of the equity).

**Formula**:

Control Premium (%) = (Offer Price - Unaffected Stock Price) / Unaffected Stock Price × 100

**Why do buyers pay a control premium?**

When you own a minority stake (e.g., 1,000 shares out of 10 million), you have limited influence over the company's decisions. When you acquire 100% (or a controlling stake), you gain the ability to:

- Replace management
- Change strategy
- Sell assets or divisions
- Optimize capital structure
- Realize synergies with your own business

These control rights are valuable, so buyers pay more than the minority trading price to acquire them.

**Typical control premiums**: 20-40%, depending on industry, market conditions, and competitive dynamics. In highly competitive auctions, premiums can exceed 50%.

### Minority Discount

The inverse of a control premium is a **minority discount**—the reduction in value when valuing a minority (non-controlling) stake.

For example, if a company is worth $1,000M on a control basis, a 10% minority stake might be worth less than $100M due to the lack of control.

Minority discounts are relevant when valuing:

- Small equity stakes in private companies
- Shares with limited voting rights
- Situations where the buyer can't influence decisions

### Illiquidity Discount

An **illiquidity discount** (or **marketability discount**) reflects the reduced value of an asset that can't be easily sold.

Private company equity is illiquid: there's no public market, and selling shares requires finding a buyer and negotiating terms. Because of this, private company valuations are often 20-30% lower than comparable public companies.

**When does this matter?**

- Valuing private companies or private equity stakes
- Valuing restricted stock (e.g., shares that can't be sold for a period)

Illiquidity discounts are applied to account for the risk and delay in converting the asset to cash.

### Strategic Premium

A **strategic premium** is the additional amount a strategic buyer (e.g., a competitor or company in an adjacent industry) pays beyond what a financial buyer (e.g., private equity) might pay.

Strategic buyers can often justify higher prices because they expect **synergies**:

- **Cost synergies**: Eliminating duplicate functions (e.g., combining sales teams, closing redundant facilities)
- **Revenue synergies**: Cross-selling, expanding into new markets, combining product lines

Financial buyers (PE firms) typically don't have synergies, so their bids are based on the standalone value of the target plus operational improvements.

### How Different Valuation Methods Reflect Premiums

**Trading Comps (Public Market Multiples)**:
- Reflect **minority, liquid** valuations
- **Don't** include a control premium
- Represent what investors would pay for a minority stake today

**Precedent Transactions**:
- Reflect **control** valuations
- **Include** a control premium (buyers paid for 100%)
- May include strategic premiums if the buyers were strategic

**DCF**:
- Can be calculated on either a minority or control basis
- **Standalone DCF**: No control premium or synergies (minority basis)
- **DCF with synergies**: Includes synergies and reflects control value

When comparing valuation methods, it's important to understand which premiums are baked in.

### Reconciling Different Valuation Methods

It's common for different valuation methods to produce different ranges:

- **Trading comps** might value a company at $800M - $1,000M (minority basis)
- **Precedent transactions** might suggest $1,000M - $1,200M (control basis with premium)
- **DCF** might yield $900M - $1,100M (standalone)

These differences are expected:

- Precedent transactions should be higher due to control premiums
- Trading comps reflect current market sentiment
- DCF is based on fundamental cash flows and assumptions

Bankers typically present all three methods in a "football field" chart, showing the range of values across methods. The final valuation or offer price is informed by all three, plus qualitative factors like competitive dynamics, seller motivation, and strategic fit.

### Interview Question: "Why Might a DCF Value Be Different from Comps?"

**Possible reasons**:

1. **Market sentiment**: Comps reflect current market multiples, which can be inflated (bubble) or depressed (downturn). DCF is based on fundamentals.
2. **Growth assumptions**: DCF uses company-specific growth and margin projections. Comps apply industry averages.
3. **Control premium**: If the DCF includes synergies, it may be higher than trading comps (which are minority valuations).
4. **Discount rate**: DCF is sensitive to WACC assumptions. Small changes in WACC can swing value significantly.

Both methods are useful. DCF provides an intrinsic value based on cash flows; comps provide a market-based benchmark.

### Common Mistakes

**Not adjusting for control when comparing methods**: Trading comps are minority valuations; precedent transactions include control premiums. Don't compare them directly without adjusting.

**Ignoring synergies in precedent transactions**: If comps paid high multiples due to unique synergies, those may not apply to your target.

**Applying illiquidity discounts arbitrarily**: Illiquidity discounts should be based on analysis, not guesses. 20-30% is a common range, but context matters.

**Confusing strategic value with market value**: Just because a strategic buyer might pay $1.2B doesn't mean the market will value the company at $1.2B.
