## Written Guide

### What Is Precedent Transaction Analysis?

**Precedent transaction analysis (precedent transactions or transaction comps)** values a company based on the prices paid in recent M&A transactions involving comparable companies.

Unlike trading comps, which reflect minority stake valuations based on public market trading, precedent transactions reflect **control premiums**—the additional amount buyers pay to acquire 100% of a company and gain control.

Precedent transactions are commonly used in M&A contexts to establish a valuation range and justify offer prices.

### Trading Comps vs. Precedent Transactions

**Trading Comps**:
- Based on current public market trading prices
- Reflect minority stake valuations (you can't control the company by buying one share)
- Updated continuously as stock prices change

**Precedent Transactions**:
- Based on actual M&A deal prices
- Reflect control premiums (buyers pay more to acquire the whole company)
- Historical and static (deals don't change once closed)

Precedent transactions typically yield **higher valuations** than trading comps due to the control premium.

### The Precedent Transactions Methodology

The process is similar to trading comps:

1. **Identify relevant transactions**: Find recent M&A deals involving companies comparable to the target.
2. **Gather transaction details**: Collect deal value (enterprise value), target financials, and deal terms.
3. **Calculate transaction multiples**: Compute multiples like EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA based on deal values.
4. **Apply multiples to the target**: Use the median or range to estimate the target's value.

### Step 1: Identify Relevant Transactions

Select transactions that are:

**Recent**: Typically within the last 2-3 years. Older deals may not reflect current market conditions or industry dynamics.

**Comparable**: The target companies should be similar in industry, size, geography, and business model.

**Closed or Announced**: Include only deals that have closed or been publicly announced with disclosed terms.

**Disclosed Financials**: You need the target's revenue, EBITDA, or other metrics to calculate multiples.

Precedent transaction databases (e.g., FactSet, CapIQ, Merger Market) are used to find deals.

### Step 2: Gather Transaction Details

For each transaction, collect:

- **Enterprise value**: Total deal value (equity value + net debt assumed)
- **Target financials**: Revenue, EBITDA, EBIT (typically LTM at the time of the deal)
- **Deal structure**: All-cash, stock, or mixed
- **Premium paid**: Offer price vs. target's stock price before announcement

### Step 3: Calculate Transaction Multiples

The most common multiples are:

**EV / Revenue**:
- Useful for high-growth or unprofitable targets

**EV / EBITDA**:
- The most common multiple in M&A

**Premium Paid**:
- (Offer Price - Pre-Announcement Stock Price) / Pre-Announcement Stock Price
- Shows how much more the buyer paid relative to where the target was trading

**Example**:

Transaction 1:
- EV = $500M
- LTM EBITDA = $50M
- EV/EBITDA = 10.0×

Transaction 2:
- EV = $1,200M
- LTM EBITDA = $100M
- EV/EBITDA = 12.0×

Transaction 3:
- EV = $800M
- LTM EBITDA = $80M
- EV/EBITDA = 10.0×

Median EV/EBITDA = 10.0×

### Step 4: Apply Multiples to the Target

If the target has LTM EBITDA of $60M and the median transaction multiple is 10.0×:

Implied EV = $60M × 10.0 = $600M

Subtract net debt to get equity value.

### Control Premium

The **control premium** is the difference between the price paid in an M&A transaction and the target's pre-announcement stock price.

**Formula**:

Control Premium (%) = (Offer Price - Unaffected Stock Price) / Unaffected Stock Price × 100

**Example**:

- Target's stock price before announcement: $40
- Offer price: $50

Control Premium = ($50 - $40) / $40 = 25%

Control premiums typically range from **20-40%**, depending on the industry, market conditions, and competitive dynamics.

### When to Use Precedent Transactions

Precedent transactions are most useful in:

- **M&A contexts**: When valuing a company for acquisition, precedent deals provide a benchmark.
- **Fairness opinions**: Bankers use precedent transactions to justify whether an offer price is "fair."
- **Active M&A markets**: Industries with frequent deal activity (e.g., tech, healthcare) have more relevant precedents.

### Limitations of Precedent Transactions

**Deals are historical**: Market conditions, interest rates, and valuations may have changed since the deals closed.

**Limited data**: Some deals are private or terms aren't disclosed, reducing the sample size.

**No two deals are identical**: Each transaction has unique strategic rationale, synergies, competitive dynamics, and buyer motivations.

**Control premium varies**: The premium paid depends on the buyer's strategic interest, competition for the target, and market conditions.

### Common Mistakes

**Using outdated transactions**: A deal from 5 years ago may not reflect current valuations.

**Ignoring deal structure**: All-cash deals may trade at different multiples than stock deals due to risk and tax considerations.

**Not adjusting for synergies**: If a buyer paid a high multiple due to unique synergies, that may not be replicable for your target.

**Confusing transaction value with equity value**: Transaction value is enterprise value. Make sure you're using the right metrics.
