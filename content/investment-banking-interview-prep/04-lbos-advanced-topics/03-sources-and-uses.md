# Sources and Uses in an LBO

## Learning Objectives

- Explain what a sources and uses table is and why it's the foundation of LBO modeling
- Identify the typical sources of funds in an LBO (debt, equity, rollover equity)
- Identify the typical uses of funds (purchase equity, refinance debt, transaction fees)
- Construct a basic sources and uses table for an interview question

## Written Guide

### What Is a Sources and Uses Table?

A **sources and uses table** shows where the money comes from (sources) and where it goes (uses) in an LBO transaction. It's the foundation of any LBO model and must balance: **Total Sources = Total Uses**.

The table answers two fundamental questions:

1. **How is the deal being financed?** (Sources)
2. **What is the money being used for?** (Uses)

### Uses of Funds

The **uses side** shows what the buyer is paying for and any additional costs. Common line items:

**1. Purchase Equity**:
- The value paid to the target's existing equity holders
- This is the equity value of the target (often purchase price minus debt assumed)

**2. Refinance Existing Debt** (if applicable):
- If the target has existing debt that will be repaid at closing, it's a use of funds
- In some LBOs, existing debt is refinanced with new debt

**3. Transaction Fees and Expenses**:
- Legal, advisory, and financing fees
- Typically 2-5% of the deal value

**4. Other**:
- Any other upfront costs, such as change-of-control payments or breakup fees

**Total Uses** = Purchase Equity + Refinance Debt + Fees

### Sources of Funds

The **sources side** shows how the deal is financed. Common line items:

**1. Debt Financing**:
- Bank debt (revolving credit facility, term loans)
- High-yield bonds or mezzanine debt
- Typically 60-70% of total sources

Debt is often broken down by type:
- **Revolver**: A flexible credit line (often undrawn at close)
- **Term Loan A**: Amortizing, senior secured
- **Term Loan B**: Longer maturity, bullet repayment
- **Senior Notes / High-Yield Bonds**: Unsecured, higher interest
- **Subordinated / Mezzanine Debt**: Junior to other debt, highest interest

**2. Equity Contribution**:
- Cash invested by the PE sponsor
- Typically 30-40% of total sources

**3. Rollover Equity** (if applicable):
- Existing shareholders (e.g., management or founders) may roll part of their equity into the new entity
- This reduces the cash equity required from the sponsor

**4. Management Equity** (if applicable):
- Management may invest alongside the sponsor

**5. Cash on Hand** (if applicable):
- If the target has excess cash, it can be used to fund part of the transaction

**Total Sources** = Debt + Sponsor Equity + Rollover Equity + Other

### Example Sources and Uses Table

**Assumptions**:
- Purchase price (equity value): $500M
- Existing debt to be refinanced: $100M
- Transaction fees: $20M
- Debt financing: $420M (70% of deal value)
- Sponsor equity: $180M (30%)
- Rollover equity from management: $20M

**Uses**:
- Purchase Equity: $500M
- Refinance Existing Debt: $100M
- Transaction Fees: $20M
- **Total Uses**: $620M

**Sources**:
- New Debt Financing: $420M
- Sponsor Equity Contribution: $180M
- Rollover Equity: $20M
- **Total Sources**: $620M

Sources = Uses ✓

### Why Sources and Uses Must Balance

The sources and uses table must balance because every dollar used must come from somewhere. If uses exceed sources, the deal is underfunded. If sources exceed uses, there's excess cash (which might go to the balance sheet or be treated as a use).

### Interview Question: "Walk Me Through a Sources and Uses"

**Sample Answer**:

"On the uses side, we're paying for the target's equity, refinancing its existing debt, and covering transaction fees. On the sources side, we're financing the deal with a mix of debt—typically 60-70% of the total—and sponsor equity, which makes up the remaining 30-40%. In some cases, management may roll over part of their equity, which reduces the sponsor's cash requirement. The total sources must equal total uses."

### Rollover Equity: Why It Matters

**Rollover equity** allows existing shareholders (often founders or management) to retain a stake in the company post-transaction. This:

- Aligns management's interests with the PE firm
- Reduces the cash required from the sponsor
- Signals management's confidence in the deal

For example, if management rolls over $20M of equity, the sponsor invests $20M less, improving the sponsor's return on equity.

### Common Mistakes

**Forgetting transaction fees**: Fees are a use of funds and must be included.

**Not refinancing existing debt**: If the target has debt that will be repaid at closing, it's a use. If the debt remains on the balance sheet, it's not a use (but affects the purchase price calculation).

**Confusing purchase price (equity value) with enterprise value**: The purchase equity line is equity value. If you're given EV, subtract net debt to get equity value.

**Not balancing the table**: Sources must equal uses. If they don't, there's an error.

## Key Takeaways

- Sources and uses shows how an LBO is financed (sources) and what the money is used for (uses)
- Uses: purchase equity, refinance debt, transaction fees
- Sources: debt (60-70%), sponsor equity (30-40%), rollover equity, other
- Total sources must equal total uses
- Rollover equity reduces the sponsor's cash requirement and aligns management's interests
- Always include transaction fees in the uses side
