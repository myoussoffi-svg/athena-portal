# Debt Structure in LBOs

## Learning Objectives

- Explain the different types of debt used in LBOs and their characteristics
- Understand the seniority structure: secured vs. unsecured, senior vs. subordinated
- Describe typical debt terms: interest rates, maturity, covenants, amortization
- Evaluate why LBOs use multiple layers of debt (the "debt stack")

## Written Guide

### Why LBOs Use Multiple Types of Debt

LBOs are financed with several types of debt, each with different characteristics, costs, and risks. This "debt stack" allows the buyer to:

- Maximize leverage (lower equity contribution)
- Match debt terms to cash flow profile (some debt amortizes, some doesn't)
- Balance cost and risk (senior debt is cheaper but more restrictive)

The debt stack is layered by **seniority**: in a default or bankruptcy, senior debt is repaid first, then subordinated debt, and equity holders are last.

### The Debt Stack: From Senior to Junior

**1. Revolving Credit Facility (Revolver)**:
- A flexible line of credit (e.g., $50M available, but not necessarily drawn)
- Used for working capital or short-term needs
- **Senior secured** (first lien on assets)
- Lowest interest rate (SOFR + 200-300 bps)
- Short maturity (3-5 years)
- Often undrawn at closing

**2. Term Loan A (TLA)**:
- Amortizing loan (principal is paid down over time)
- **Senior secured** (first lien)
- Lower interest rate (SOFR + 250-350 bps)
- Moderate maturity (5-7 years)
- Stricter covenants

**3. Term Loan B (TLB)**:
- Longer maturity (7-8 years)
- Bullet repayment (principal paid at maturity, not amortized)
- **Senior secured** (first lien or second lien)
- Higher interest rate than TLA (SOFR + 350-500 bps)
- Fewer covenants ("covenant-lite")
- Often sold to institutional investors (CLOs, hedge funds)

**4. Senior Notes / High-Yield Bonds**:
- **Unsecured** (no collateral)
- Higher interest rate (6-10%+, fixed or floating)
- Longer maturity (8-10 years)
- Traded in the bond market
- Fewer covenants, but often include call protection (restrictions on early repayment)

**5. Subordinated Debt / Mezzanine Debt**:
- **Unsecured and subordinated** (repaid after senior debt in a default)
- Highest interest rate (10-15%+)
- May include equity kickers (warrants or equity participation)
- Used to bridge the gap between senior debt and equity
- Less common in recent years due to availability of covenant-lite TLBs

### Secured vs. Unsecured

**Secured Debt**:
- Backed by collateral (assets of the company)
- If the company defaults, secured lenders can seize assets
- Lower interest rates due to lower risk
- Examples: Revolver, Term Loan A, Term Loan B

**Unsecured Debt**:
- Not backed by specific collateral
- Higher risk → higher interest rates
- Examples: High-yield bonds, subordinated debt

### Covenants

**Covenants** are terms in the debt agreement that restrict the borrower's actions and protect lenders. They fall into two categories:

**1. Maintenance Covenants**:
- Require the company to maintain certain financial ratios (e.g., Debt/EBITDA < 5.0×, Interest Coverage > 3.0×)
- Tested quarterly
- Common in Term Loan A and revolvers
- Breach can trigger default

**2. Incurrence Covenants**:
- Restrict specific actions (e.g., cannot incur additional debt, make acquisitions, or pay dividends beyond certain limits)
- Only tested if the company takes the restricted action
- Common in high-yield bonds and covenant-lite loans

**Covenant-lite loans** have fewer or no maintenance covenants, giving the borrower more flexibility. They became common after the financial crisis and are now standard for Term Loan B and high-yield bonds.

### Amortization vs. Bullet Repayment

**Amortization**:
- Principal is repaid gradually over the life of the loan
- Reduces outstanding debt and interest expense over time
- Common in Term Loan A

**Bullet Repayment**:
- Principal is repaid in full at maturity
- No amortization during the life of the loan
- Common in Term Loan B, high-yield bonds, and subordinated debt

LBOs often use a mix: some debt amortizes (reducing leverage over time), and some is bullet (preserving cash for growth or other uses).

### Why the Debt Stack Exists

The debt stack allows the borrower to:

- **Maximize leverage**: By using multiple types of debt, the company can borrow more than it could with a single lender
- **Optimize cost**: Senior secured debt is cheap; subordinated debt is expensive. Use more senior debt to lower the blended cost
- **Match cash flow**: Amortizing debt (TLA) reduces leverage steadily; bullet debt (TLB, bonds) defers repayment until exit

Lenders accept this structure because each layer has different risk/return profiles. Senior lenders have collateral and first claim on cash flows. Subordinated lenders accept higher risk in exchange for higher returns.

### Typical LBO Debt Structure (Example)

For a $1,000M LBO:

- Revolver: $50M (5%) - undrawn at close
- Term Loan A: $150M (15%)
- Term Loan B: $300M (30%)
- Senior Notes: $200M (20%)
- Sponsor Equity: $300M (30%)

Total Debt: $700M (70%)
Total Equity: $300M (30%)

### Common Mistakes

**Confusing seniority with security**: "Senior" means it's repaid first. "Secured" means it's backed by collateral. Senior unsecured debt exists (e.g., senior notes).

**Not understanding covenant-lite**: Covenant-lite loans are common now, especially for Term Loan B. Don't assume all loans have maintenance covenants.

**Forgetting that revolvers are often undrawn**: A revolver provides liquidity but may not be drawn at closing. It's a source of funds (committed), but not necessarily a use.

**Thinking all debt amortizes**: Most LBO debt is bullet (TLB, bonds). Only TLA and sometimes revolver amortize.

## Key Takeaways

- LBOs use multiple layers of debt (the "debt stack") to maximize leverage and optimize cost
- Debt stack (senior to junior): Revolver, Term Loan A, Term Loan B, Senior Notes, Subordinated Debt
- Senior secured debt (revolver, TLA, TLB) is backed by collateral and has lower interest rates
- Unsecured debt (high-yield bonds, subordinated debt) has higher interest rates and no collateral
- Covenants restrict borrower actions; covenant-lite loans have fewer restrictions
- Some debt amortizes (TLA); most is bullet repayment (TLB, bonds)
