# Scaling Outreach Without Losing Quality

## Learning Objectives

- Build systems that allow you to send more emails without sacrificing personalization
- Manage a high volume of contacts and conversations efficiently
- Avoid burnout while maintaining consistent outreach over months
- Adapt your approach based on results and feedback

## Written Guide

### The Volume Problem

Effective IB networking requires reaching out to 100-200 people across your target banks. You can't write each email from scratch, but generic mass emails get ignored.

The solution is systematized personalization—building processes that let you scale while keeping the quality that actually gets responses.

### Building Your Outreach System

**Step 1: Create your master template library**

You need 3-4 base templates that cover your main scenarios:

- Alumni from your school
- Referral-based outreach
- Shared background (non-alumni)
- Follow-up templates (first and second)

These templates should have clear placeholders for the elements you'll personalize:

```
Hi [FIRST_NAME],

I found your profile through [CONNECTION_SOURCE] and noticed you're in [GROUP] at [BANK] after [RELEVANT_BACKGROUND_DETAIL]. I'm a [YEAR] at [SCHOOL] recruiting for IB summer positions.

Would you have 15-20 minutes for a quick call in the coming weeks? I'd appreciate any perspective on your experience in [GROUP].

Completely understand if you're too busy. Thanks either way.

Best,
[YOUR_NAME]
```

**Step 2: Batch your research**

Don't research one person, write an email, research the next person, write an email. This constant switching kills efficiency.

Instead:
1. Spend 30-60 minutes researching 10-15 contacts
2. Fill in a spreadsheet with key personalization details for each
3. Then spend 30-60 minutes writing emails using your notes

**Step 3: Create a personalization checklist**

For each email, you must customize at minimum:

- [ ] Their name (spelled correctly)
- [ ] Their bank and group
- [ ] One specific detail about them (graduation year, previous company, shared background)
- [ ] Why you're reaching out to them specifically

If you can't check all four boxes, do more research or skip that contact.

### What to Personalize vs. What to Templatize

**Always personalize:**
- The specific detail that connects you to them
- Their name and current role
- Any reference to their specific group or recent work

**Safe to templatize:**
- Your self-introduction
- The general ask (15-20 minute call)
- The "easy out" sentence
- Your signature

**Never templatize:**
- The subject line (even small customizations matter)
- The opening sentence (this is where personalization has the most impact)

### Daily and Weekly Rhythms

**Daily routine (30-45 minutes):**

1. Check for responses and reply immediately (5-10 min)
2. Send 3-5 new emails using your prepared batch (15-20 min)
3. Review who needs follow-ups and send them (10-15 min)

**Weekly routine (60-90 minutes):**

1. Batch research for next week's contacts (30-45 min)
2. Review metrics: response rate, call conversion rate, emails sent (15 min)
3. Prepare for upcoming calls by reviewing notes (15-30 min)
4. Update your tracker and clean up outdated entries (15 min)

### Managing High-Volume Conversations

When your outreach starts working, you'll have multiple calls per week and many relationships to maintain. Here's how to stay organized:

**Before each call, review:**
- Your original email exchange
- Their LinkedIn profile
- Notes from any previous interactions
- What you want to learn from this specific person

**After each call, document:**
- Key takeaways and advice they gave
- Names they mentioned for follow-up
- Any commitments you made
- Whether they agreed to refer you or introduce you to others

**Maintain a relationship status field:**

| Status | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| Contacted | Email sent, no response yet |
| Engaged | Responded positively, call pending |
| Spoke | Had a call, relationship established |
| Advocate | Agreed to refer or has actively helped |
| Cold | No response after 2 follow-ups |

### Avoiding Common Scale Mistakes

**1. Copy-paste errors**

The fastest way to kill a relationship is to send an email that says "Hi [FIRST_NAME]" or references the wrong bank. Triple-check every email before sending.

**2. Losing track of who you've contacted**

Reaching out to someone who already ignored you, or emailing the same person twice, signals disorganization. Your tracker is your source of truth—update it religiously.

**3. Depersonalization creep**

As you send more emails, the temptation to cut corners grows. Resist it. One highly personalized email beats five generic ones.

**4. Neglecting active relationships while chasing new contacts**

A contact who already took your call is more valuable than a stranger. Don't forget to maintain relationships while pursuing new ones.

**5. Burnout from unsustainable intensity**

Networking is a marathon, not a sprint. Sending 50 emails in one day and then nothing for two weeks is less effective than 5 emails per day for two weeks.

### Adapting Based on Results

After 2-3 weeks of outreach, review your data:

**If your response rate is below 10%:**
- Are you personalizing enough? Review rejected emails for generic language
- Are you targeting the right people? Analysts and associates respond more than VPs
- Is your subject line getting opened? Try more specific subject lines
- Is your timing off? Experiment with different send times

**If you're getting responses but not calls:**
- Are you making the ask clear? "15-20 minute call" should be explicit
- Are you responding quickly? Reply within a few hours
- Are you proposing specific times? Don't say "whenever works"

**If calls aren't leading to referrals:**
- Are the conversations substantive? Prepare better questions
- Are you asking for referrals? Many people won't offer—you have to ask
- Are you following up after calls? The thank-you email matters

### Sample Weekly Schedule

| Day | Activity | Time |
|-----|----------|------|
| Monday | Batch research for the week | 45 min |
| Tuesday | Send 5 new emails, follow-ups | 30 min |
| Wednesday | Send 5 new emails, follow-ups, 1-2 calls | 60 min |
| Thursday | Send 5 new emails, follow-ups | 30 min |
| Friday | Calls as scheduled, weekly review | 45 min |
| Weekend | Light catch-up if needed | 15 min |

Total: ~4 hours/week during active recruiting season

### Long-Term Sustainability

IB recruiting can span 3-6 months. To maintain quality over this period:

**Pace yourself:** 5 emails per day, 5 days per week = 100 emails per month. This is sustainable.

**Take breaks:** If you're feeling burned out, skip a day. Consistency over time beats intensity in short bursts.

**Celebrate small wins:** Every positive response, every good call, every referral is progress. Acknowledge it.

**Remember the goal:** You don't need 200 advocates. You need 3-5 people per target bank who know you and will vouch for you. Quality of relationships matters more than quantity of contacts.

## Key Takeaways

- Build a template library but personalize every email with at least four specific details
- Batch your work: research 10-15 people, then write 10-15 emails
- Establish daily (30-45 min) and weekly (60-90 min) routines to maintain consistency
- Track everything: response rates, call conversions, relationship status
- Avoid copy-paste errors, depersonalization, and neglecting existing relationships
- Pace yourself for 3-6 months of recruiting—5 emails per day is sustainable
- Adapt based on results: review metrics every 2-3 weeks and adjust your approach
