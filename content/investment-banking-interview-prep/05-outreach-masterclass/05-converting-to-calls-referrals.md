# Converting Emails into Calls and Referrals

## Learning Objectives

- Transition from email response to scheduled phone call efficiently
- Conduct networking calls that leave a strong impression
- Ask for referrals and introductions without being awkward
- Convert casual contacts into active advocates for your candidacy

## Written Guide

### Scheduling the Call

When someone responds positively to your email, your goal is to get a call on the calendar quickly. Don't let the thread die.

**Response to a positive reply:**

> Hi [First Name],
>
> Thanks so much for getting back to me. I really appreciate it.
>
> I'm flexible on timing—would any of these work for a 15-20 minute call?
> - Tuesday 10/15: 7-8 AM or 6-8 PM
> - Wednesday 10/16: 7-9 AM or 5-7 PM
> - Thursday 10/17: 6-8 PM
>
> Happy to adjust if none of those work. Also, should I call you, or would you prefer to call me?
>
> Best,
> [Your Name]
> [Your Phone Number]

**Key principles:**

- Offer specific times rather than "whenever works for you"
- Include early morning and evening options (bankers have unpredictable days)
- Provide your phone number immediately
- Respond within a few hours to maintain momentum

### Preparing for the Call

Before every networking call, prepare:

**Research the person (10 minutes)**
- Review their LinkedIn for career path and background
- Note any shared experiences or connections
- Look up recent deals their group has worked on
- Check if they've published anything or been quoted in articles

**Prepare your questions (10 minutes)**

Have 5-7 questions ready, organized from general to specific:

1. How did you decide on investment banking / this group / this bank?
2. What does a typical week look like in your role?
3. What's been the most interesting project you've worked on recently?
4. What do you wish you'd known before starting the job?
5. What differentiates candidates who do well in interviews at your bank?
6. Is there anyone else you'd recommend I speak with?

**Prepare your own talking points (5 minutes)**

- A 30-second version of your background
- Why you're interested in their bank/group specifically
- 1-2 thoughtful questions specific to their experience

### During the Call

**The first 2 minutes:**

- Thank them for making time
- Briefly explain your background and situation (30 seconds max)
- Transition to your first question

Bad opening: "So, like, I'm really interested in banking and I've been trying to learn more about what it's like..."

Good opening: "Thanks for making time. I'm a junior at Michigan recruiting for IB summer positions. I'm especially interested in healthcare coverage given my bio background, so I was excited to connect with someone in your group. To start, I'd love to hear how you ended up in GS Healthcare after [previous experience]."

**The middle of the call:**

- Ask your prepared questions but let the conversation flow naturally
- Listen more than you talk—aim for 70% them, 30% you
- Take notes on key points (they'll be useful for your thank-you and future outreach)
- Ask follow-up questions based on what they say

**Questions to avoid:**

- "What's the work-life balance like?" (shows wrong priorities)
- "How much do analysts make?" (research this yourself)
- "Will you refer me?" (too direct—see below for how to ask)
- "What should I know for interviews?" (too generic—be more specific)

**The last 3 minutes:**

- Watch the time and don't go over unless they extend
- Ask if there's anyone else they'd recommend you speak with
- Thank them sincerely and mention you'll follow up

### Asking for Referrals

Referrals don't happen automatically. You need to create the opening and make it easy for them to say yes.

**When to ask:**

At the end of a call that went well—not via email before you've spoken, and not during the first few minutes of a conversation.

**How to ask for introductions to others:**

> "This has been really helpful. Is there anyone else on your team or at the bank you'd recommend I speak with?"

Most people will say yes to this. If they offer a name, follow up with:

> "Would you be comfortable making an introduction, or would you prefer I reach out directly and mention that you suggested I contact them?"

Some people prefer to make warm intros; others prefer you email directly. Let them choose.

**How to ask about formal referrals:**

At banks with formal referral programs, employees can submit candidates directly to recruiting. This is different from an introduction—it's an endorsement.

Only ask for this after:
- You've had a substantive conversation
- They seem genuinely positive about you
- You've demonstrated you're a serious candidate

> "I really appreciate all your advice. When applications open, would you be open to submitting a referral on my behalf? I understand if you'd rather wait to see how things develop—just wanted to ask."

**If they say no or hesitate:**

Don't push. Say "Totally understand" and move on. Asking once is fine; asking twice damages the relationship.

### Converting Contacts into Advocates

The goal isn't just to collect conversations—it's to find people who will actively support you. Here's how to turn a contact into an advocate:

**1. Be memorable for the right reasons**

- Come prepared with thoughtful questions
- Demonstrate genuine interest in their experience
- Follow up promptly and professionally
- Show initiative by acting on their advice

**2. Make their job easy**

When asking for a referral, offer to send:
- Your resume (updated and polished)
- A brief summary of your background and target groups
- Any specific talking points they might use when advocating for you

**3. Keep them updated**

People want to know if their help led to something. Send updates:
- When you submit your application
- When you get an interview
- When you receive an offer or make a decision

**4. Show gratitude without being excessive**

A sincere thank-you is memorable. Excessive flattery or repeated expressions of gratitude become awkward. One thank-you email after the call is enough.

### What Happens After You Get an Interview

If your networking leads to an interview, your contacts become even more valuable:

**Before the interview:**

> "Hi [First Name], wanted to let you know I have a first-round interview at [Bank] next week. Any last-minute advice on what to expect or prepare for?"

**After the interview:**

> "Hi [First Name], just finished my first round at [Bank]. Went well—thanks again for your advice on [specific thing]. I'll keep you posted on next steps."

**If you get the offer:**

> "Great news—I received an offer from [Bank] and I'm planning to accept. Couldn't have done it without your help. Thank you."

This closes the loop and shows you're someone who follows through—which matters for your reputation down the line.

- Only ask for formal referrals after you've had a substantive conversation and they're clearly positive
