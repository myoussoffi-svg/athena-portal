# Cold Email Anatomy and Structure

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the components of an effective networking email
- Write subject lines that get opened
- Structure email body copy that gets responses
- Identify and avoid common email mistakes that kill response rates

## Written Guide

### The Goal of a Cold Email

Your email has one job: get a response that leads to a conversation. It's not a cover letter. It's not your life story. It's a concise request that makes it easy for someone to say yes.

The person receiving your email is busy. They will decide whether to respond within 10 seconds of opening it. Every sentence must earn its place.

### Subject Line

The subject line determines whether your email gets opened. Keep it short, specific, and relevant to the recipient.

**Effective subject lines:**

- `[Your University] Junior - Quick Question About GS TMT`
- `Fellow Michigan Alum - Coffee Chat Request`
- `Referred by Sarah Chen - Interested in Evercore LA`
- `[Your Name] - Question About Analyst Experience at Moelis`

**Weak subject lines:**

- `Networking Request` (too generic)
- `Hello!` (unprofessional)
- `Investment Banking Opportunity Question` (vague)
- `I Would Love to Pick Your Brain` (overused phrase)

### Email Structure

Every networking email should follow this structure:

**1. Opening line (1 sentence)**

Establish your connection or explain how you found them. Be specific.

**2. Brief background (1-2 sentences)**

Who you are and why you're reaching out. Keep it tight.

**3. The ask (1 sentence)**

What you want—typically a 15-20 minute phone call.

**4. Easy out (1 sentence)**

Make it low-pressure and easy to decline.

**5. Sign-off**

Professional closing with your full name.

Total length: 5-7 sentences. If your email is longer than this, cut it.

### Good Email vs. Bad Email

**Bad email:**

> Subject: Networking
>
> Dear Mr. Johnson,
>
> My name is Alex Thompson and I am a junior at Ohio State University majoring in Finance with a minor in Economics. I have always been passionate about investment banking and have been following the industry closely for several years. I am reaching out because I am very interested in learning more about your career path and the work you do at Goldman Sachs.
>
> I have had several internships in financial services including a summer position at a local wealth management firm where I gained exposure to financial analysis and client management. I am a member of the Finance Club and the Investment Banking Club at my university, and I am currently preparing for summer analyst recruiting.
>
> I would be extremely grateful if you could spare some time to speak with me about your experience at Goldman Sachs and offer any advice you might have for someone looking to break into the industry. I am available any time that works for you and would be happy to work around your schedule.
>
> Thank you so much for your time and consideration. I really appreciate it.
>
> Best regards,
> Alex Thompson

**Why it fails:**

- Generic subject line
- Opens with "My name is..." (wastes the first sentence)
- Too long—takes 30 seconds to read
- No specific connection mentioned
- Vague about what they actually want
- Excessive gratitude sounds desperate

**Good email:**

> Subject: Ohio State Junior - Quick Question About GS TMT
>
> Hi John,
>
> I found your profile through the Ohio State alumni network and noticed you joined Goldman's TMT group after graduating in 2022. I'm a junior at Ohio State recruiting for IB this summer and am particularly interested in tech coverage.
>
> Would you have 15-20 minutes for a quick call in the next few weeks? I'd love to hear about your experience in the group and any advice for someone going through recruiting.
>
> Totally understand if your schedule doesn't allow—I know things get busy. Either way, thanks for reading this.
>
> Best,
> Alex Thompson
> Ohio State '25 | Finance

**Why it works:**

- Specific subject line with school and group
- Opens with the connection (shared alma mater)
- Shows you did research (knows their group and start year)
- Clear, specific ask (15-20 minute call)
- Easy out reduces pressure
- 5 sentences total

### Email Templates

**Template 1: Alumni outreach**

> Subject: [University] [Year] - Question About [Bank] [Group]
>
> Hi [First Name],
>
> I came across your profile on [LinkedIn/alumni directory] and saw that you're in [Group] at [Bank] after graduating from [University] in [Year]. I'm currently a [year] at [University] recruiting for IB summer analyst positions.
>
> Would you have 15-20 minutes in the next couple weeks for a quick call? I'd appreciate any perspective on your experience in [Group] and the recruiting process.
>
> Completely understand if you're too busy—I know how demanding the job is. Thanks either way.
>
> Best,
> [Your Name]
> [University] '[Year] | [Major]

**Template 2: Referral-based outreach**

> Subject: Referred by [Referrer Name] - [Bank] [Group] Question
>
> Hi [First Name],
>
> [Referrer Name] suggested I reach out—we spoke last week about their experience at [Bank], and they mentioned you'd be a great person to talk to about [specific topic].
>
> I'm a [year] at [University] recruiting for IB and am especially interested in [relevant area]. Would you have 15 minutes for a quick call?
>
> Thanks for considering, and please say hi to [Referrer] for me.
>
> Best,
> [Your Name]

**Template 3: Shared background (non-alumni)**

> Subject: Fellow [Shared Background] - Question About [Bank]
>
> Hi [First Name],
>
> I noticed on LinkedIn that you're from [hometown/state] and now work in [Group] at [Bank]. I'm also from [hometown/state], currently a [year] at [University], and recruiting for IB summer positions.
>
> Would you have 15-20 minutes to chat about your path to [Bank]? I'd love to hear how you approached recruiting.
>
> No worries if your schedule is packed. Thanks for reading.
>
> Best,
> [Your Name]

**Template 4: Pure cold outreach (no shared connection)**

Sometimes you won't have any obvious commonality with a contact—no shared school, hometown, or mutual connection. That's fine. You can still reach out effectively by focusing on genuine interest in their specific group or background.

> Subject: [Your University] Junior - Question About [Bank] [Group]
>
> Hi [First Name],
>
> I came across your profile while researching [Group] at [Bank] and noticed your background in [something specific from their LinkedIn—previous company, deal experience, or career path]. I'm a [year] at [University] recruiting for IB summer positions and am particularly interested in [relevant sector or group].
>
> Would you have 15-20 minutes for a quick call? I'd appreciate hearing about your experience in [Group] and any perspective on recruiting.
>
> Completely understand if your schedule doesn't allow. Thanks either way.
>
> Best,
> [Your Name]
> [University] '[Year] | [Major]

**Why this works without a shared connection:**

- The opening shows you researched them specifically (not a mass email)
- Mentioning something from their profile shows genuine effort
- The ask is still clear and low-pressure
- You're not pretending to have a connection that doesn't exist

### A Note on Commonality

The templates above emphasize shared connections—alumni networks, referrals, hometown, etc.—because these increase response rates. A shared background gives the recipient a reason to help you beyond pure goodwill.

However, **commonality is preferred, not required.** Don't avoid reaching out to someone just because you can't find a shared connection. A well-crafted cold email to someone with no obvious link to you will still get responses—just at a lower rate than warm outreach.

The math still works: if your alumni emails get 20% response rates and pure cold emails get 10%, sending cold emails is still worthwhile. You're not limited to people who share your background. Cast a wide net, prioritize warm connections when possible, and don't let the absence of commonality stop you from reaching out.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

**1. The resume dump**

Your email isn't a cover letter. Don't list your GPA, clubs, or every internship you've had. They can look at your LinkedIn if they want details.

**2. The flattery overload**

"I've admired Goldman Sachs for years and would be honored to speak with someone of your caliber..." This sounds insincere and wastes words.

**3. The vague ask**

"I'd love to learn more about your experience" is weaker than "Would you have 15 minutes for a call?" Be specific about what you want.

**4. The wall of text**

If someone has to scroll to read your email on their phone, it's too long. Keep it to 5-7 sentences.

**5. The desperate tone**

"I would be so incredibly grateful" and "I really hope you can help me" signal anxiety. Keep a confident, professional tone.

**6. Sending from a messy email address**

Use a professional email address. firstname.lastname@ or firstnamelastname@ are fine. PartyAlex2003@ is not.

### Timing Your Emails

**Best times to send:**

- Tuesday through Thursday
- 7-9 AM or 5-7 PM (when people check email before/after work)
- Avoid Monday mornings (inbox overload) and Friday afternoons (weekend mode)

**When to expect responses:**

- Most responses come within 48-72 hours
- If no response after one week, you can follow up
- Some people respond weeks later—this is normal

## Key Takeaways

- Your email has one job: get a response that leads to a conversation
- Keep emails to 5-7 sentences—open with your connection, state your background briefly, make a clear ask
- Subject lines should be specific: include your school, your ask, and something relevant to them
- Use the "easy out" to reduce pressure and increase response rates
- Avoid resume dumps, excessive flattery, vague asks, and desperate tones
- Send Tuesday-Thursday, early morning or early evening for best response rates
