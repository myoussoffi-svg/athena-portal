## Written Guide

### What Are Capital Markets?

**Capital markets** are financial markets where long-term debt and equity instruments are bought and sold. They serve as the mechanism through which savings are channeled into productive investments.

Capital markets enable:
- **Companies** to raise funds for growth and operations
- **Governments** to finance deficits and infrastructure
- **Investors** to deploy capital and earn returns

Without capital markets, businesses would struggle to fund expansion beyond what they can self-finance, and investors would have limited options for putting savings to work.

### Primary vs. Secondary Markets

**Primary Market**: Where new securities are created and sold for the first time

- IPOs (Initial Public Offerings)
- Follow-on equity offerings
- Bond issuances
- Private placements

In the primary market, proceeds go to the issuing company.

**Secondary Market**: Where existing securities trade between investors

- Stock exchanges (NYSE, NASDAQ)
- Bond markets
- Over-the-counter (OTC) markets

In the secondary market, proceeds go to selling investors (not the company).

**Why Secondary Markets Matter**: Liquid secondary markets make primary issuances possible. Investors buy new securities knowing they can sell them later.

### Key Market Participants

**Issuers** — Entities that raise capital

```calculation

**Intermediaries** — Facilitate transactions

```calculation

  - "Category: Type, Role"
steps:
  - "Investment Banks: Underwrite securities, advise issuers"
  - "Brokers: Execute trades for clients"
  - "Dealers/Market Makers: Buy/sell securities from own inventory, provide liquidity"
  - "Exchanges: Provide trading venues and price discovery"
  - "Clearing Houses: Settle trades, manage counterparty risk"
result: "Intermediaries connect issuers and investors through underwriting, trading, and settlement"
```

### Types of Capital Market Instruments

**Equity Instruments**:
- Common stock
- Preferred stock
- Depositary receipts (ADRs)
- Equity warrants

**Debt Instruments**:
- Corporate bonds
- Government bonds (Treasuries)
- Municipal bonds
- High-yield (junk) bonds

**Derivatives** (derived from underlying securities):

### The Capital Raising Process

When a company needs capital, the typical process:

**1. Determine Needs**
- How much capital?
- For what purpose? (growth, acquisition, refinancing)
- What type? (debt vs. equity)

**2. Engage Investment Bank**
- Advisory on structure and timing
- Underwriting (buying securities to resell)
- Distribution to investors

**3. Due Diligence & Documentation**
- Financial audits
- Legal review
- Prospectus/offering memorandum

**4. Marketing**
- Roadshows (management presents to investors)
- Book building (collecting investor orders)
- Price discovery

**5. Pricing & Allocation**
- Set final price based on demand
- Allocate securities to investors
- Close transaction

**6. Aftermarket**
- Securities begin trading
- Investment bank may provide stabilization

### Investment Bank's Role in Capital Markets

Investment banks serve as the critical link between issuers and investors:

**Origination**: Work with issuers to identify funding needs and structure solutions

**Underwriting**: Commit to purchase securities from the issuer (taking risk), then resell to investors

**Distribution**: Access to investor network to place securities

**Structuring**: Design securities that meet issuer and investor needs

**Advisory**: Recommend timing, pricing, and structure

### Capital Markets vs. M&A

Both are core investment banking activities, but they differ:

```calculation
title: "Capital Markets vs. M&A Comparison"
given:
  - "Comparing two core investment banking activities"
steps:
  - "Product: Capital Markets = Securities (stocks, bonds) | M&A = Deals (mergers, acquisitions)"
  - "Client Need: Capital Markets = Raise money | M&A = Buy/sell companies"
  - "Revenue Model: Capital Markets = Underwriting fees (% of deal) | M&A = Advisory fees"
  - "Repeat Business: Capital Markets = Companies raise capital regularly | M&A = Deals are episodic"
  - "Market Dependency: Capital Markets = Very sensitive to market conditions | M&A = Less sensitive"
result: "Capital Markets focuses on recurring securities issuance; M&A focuses on episodic deal advisory"
```

Many deals involve both: an M&A transaction might require debt financing from DCM and equity from ECM.

### Why Capital Markets Matter for IB Interviews

Understanding capital markets helps you:

1. **Answer "why IB?"** questions with depth
2. **Discuss market conditions** intelligently
3. **Understand deal financing** in M&A and LBO contexts
4. **Demonstrate commercial awareness** about how companies fund themselves

Common interview questions:
- "What's happening in the bond market right now?"
- "How do companies decide between debt and equity?"
- "Walk me through an IPO process"

### Market Cycles and Conditions

Capital markets activity varies with economic cycles:

**Bull Markets** (rising prices, optimism):
- High IPO activity
- Tight credit spreads
- Strong equity issuance
- M&A activity often high

**Bear Markets** (falling prices, pessimism):
- IPO window "closes"
- Credit spreads widen
- Debt refinancing difficult
- Restructuring activity increases

**Current Awareness**: Know recent major deals, market trends, and rate environment for interviews.
