# ECM, DCM, and Origination

## Learning Objectives

- Describe the IPO, follow-on, and bond issuance processes
- Explain the role of origination in capital markets

## Written Guide

### Investment Bank Capital Markets Structure

Investment banks typically organize capital markets into:

**Equity Capital Markets (ECM)**: Helps companies raise equity
- IPOs
- Follow-on offerings
- Convertible securities
- Block trades

**Debt Capital Markets (DCM)**: Helps companies raise debt
- Investment-grade bonds
- High-yield bonds
- Leveraged loans
- Structured products

**Origination**: The coverage/client-facing function that identifies opportunities and wins mandates

### Equity Capital Markets (ECM)

ECM helps companies issue shares to raise equity capital.

**Main Products**:

| Product | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| IPO | Initial Public Offering—first sale of shares to public |
| Follow-On | Additional share sale by already-public company |
| Convertible | Bond that converts to equity under certain conditions |
| Block Trade | Large secondary sale, often overnight |
| SPAC | Special Purpose Acquisition Company (blank-check IPO) |
| Rights Offering | Existing shareholders can buy new shares pro-rata |

### The IPO Process

**Phase 1: Preparation (3-6 months before)**
- Hire investment banks (lead underwriters)
- Select legal counsel and auditors
- Begin SEC registration process
- Draft prospectus (S-1 in the US)

**Phase 2: Due Diligence**
- Banks conduct thorough review
- Financial, legal, business diligence
- Identify key risks and disclosures
- Prepare management for public company life

**Phase 3: Marketing (2-3 weeks before pricing)**
- File prospectus publicly
- Launch roadshow (management presentations)
- Build book of investor orders
- Gauge demand and price sensitivity

**Phase 4: Pricing and Allocation**
- Set final price based on demand
- Allocate shares to investors
- Price typically set night before trading

**Phase 5: Trading and Stabilization**
- Stock begins trading on exchange
- Underwriters may stabilize price (buy to support)
- Quiet period restrictions on communications

### Follow-On Offerings

Companies already public can issue more shares:

**Primary Offering**: Company sells new shares; proceeds to company
**Secondary Offering**: Existing shareholders sell; proceeds to them
**Mixed**: Combination of primary and secondary

**Overnight Deals**: Faster process for known issuers
- Announcement after market close
- Priced overnight
- Trading next morning

### Debt Capital Markets (DCM)

DCM helps companies issue bonds and other debt.

**Main Products**:

| Product | Description | Typical Issuer |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Investment-Grade Bonds | High credit quality (BBB- or above) | Large corporations |
| High-Yield Bonds | Below investment grade (BB+ or below) | Leveraged companies, LBOs |
| Leveraged Loans | Bank debt for leveraged borrowers | PE portfolio companies |
| Commercial Paper | Short-term unsecured debt | Large corps for working capital |
| Municipal Bonds | Debt issued by governments | Cities, states, agencies |
| Structured Products | ABS, MBS, CLOs | Financial institutions |

### The Bond Issuance Process

**1. Mandate and Structure**
- Issuer selects banks (bookrunners)
- Determine size, maturity, structure
- Investment grade vs. high yield affects process

**2. Documentation**
- Prepare offering memorandum
- Negotiate indenture (bond contract)
- Rating agency presentations

**3. Marketing**
- Investment grade: Often "drive-by" (quick, minimal marketing)
- High yield: Roadshow similar to equity

**4. Bookbuilding**
- Announce initial price guidance (spread over benchmark)
- Collect investor orders
- Tighten pricing based on demand

**5. Pricing and Allocation**
- Set final coupon and price
- Allocate to investors
- Settle (T+2 typically)

### Leveraged Finance

**Leveraged loans** and **high-yield bonds** finance LBOs and leveraged transactions:

**Key Differences from Investment Grade**:

| Aspect | Investment Grade | Leveraged Finance |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| Credit Rating | BBB- or above | BB+ or below |
| Spread | Low (100-200 bps) | High (300-600+ bps) |
| Covenants | Minimal | Extensive |
| Marketing | Quick | Full roadshow |
| Investor Base | Insurance, pensions | CLOs, hedge funds |
| Bank Commitment | Rarely hold | Often syndicate |

### Origination

**Origination** is the business development function that sources deals:

**Responsibilities**:
- Build relationships with corporate issuers
- Identify financing needs
- Pitch capital markets solutions
- Win mandates
- Coordinate with ECM/DCM execution

**Origination vs. Coverage**:

In some banks, origination sits in capital markets. In others, **industry coverage** bankers (M&A focused) source capital markets deals alongside advisory work.

**The Pitch**:
- Market update (conditions, comparable deals)
- Proposed structure and timing
- Execution capabilities
- Fees

### Underwriting and Risk

**Underwriting** means the bank commits to purchase securities from the issuer:

**Firm Commitment**: Bank guarantees to buy all securities at agreed price
- Bank takes risk if can't sell to investors
- Most common for large deals

**Best Efforts**: Bank agrees to sell as much as possible
- Issuer takes risk of underselling
- Common for smaller or riskier deals

**Bought Deal**: Bank purchases entire offering immediately
- Highest risk for bank
- Requires strong confidence in demand

### Economics: Capital Markets Fees

**ECM Fees** (as % of proceeds):
| Transaction Type | Typical Fee |
|------------------|-------------|
| IPO | 5-7% |
| Follow-On | 2-4% |
| Block Trade | 1-2% |
| Convertible | 2-3% |

**DCM Fees** (as % of proceeds):
| Transaction Type | Typical Fee |
|------------------|-------------|
| Investment-Grade Bond | 0.2-0.5% |
| High-Yield Bond | 1.5-2.5% |
| Leveraged Loan | 1-2% |

DCM fees are lower per dollar but volumes are much higher.

### Relationship with Other Divisions

**Coverage/M&A**: Often sources capital markets opportunities alongside advisory
- M&A deal needs financing? Bring in ECM/DCM
- Client relationship owned by coverage

**Sales & Trading**: Distributes securities to investors
- ECM/DCM structures; S&T sells
- Feedback from S&T on investor appetite

**Research**: Provides analysis and recommendations
- Equity research coverage important for IPOs
- Credit research for bond deals

### Global Markets / Sales & Trading

While ECM and DCM are "origination" (issuance), **Sales & Trading** handles secondary markets:

**Sales**: Maintains investor relationships, pitches ideas
**Trading**: Executes trades, provides market liquidity, manages risk

Capital markets bankers work with S&T to:
- Gauge investor demand before deals
- Distribute securities during offerings
- Provide aftermarket support

### Interview Relevance

Knowing ECM/DCM shows understanding of the full investment bank:

**Common Questions**:
- "Walk me through an IPO"
- "What's the difference between ECM and DCM?"
- "How does a bond issuance work?"
- "What's the relationship between capital markets and M&A?"

**Why It Matters**:
- Many deals involve capital markets components
- Shows commercial awareness
- Demonstrates you understand how banks make money

- Bond process: mandate → documentation → marketing → bookbuilding → pricing
- Leveraged finance (HY bonds, leveraged loans) finances LBOs with higher spreads and more covenants
- Origination sources deals and wins mandates; execution teams structure and distribute
- Firm commitment underwriting means the bank guarantees to buy; carries risk
- ECM fees higher (5-7% for IPOs) but lower volumes; DCM fees lower (0.2-2.5%) but higher volumes
- Capital markets works with coverage (client relationships) and S&T (distribution)
