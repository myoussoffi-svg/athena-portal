# ECM, DCM, and Origination

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the structure and functions of ECM and DCM groups
- Describe the IPO, follow-on, and bond issuance processes
- Explain the role of origination in capital markets
- Understand how capital markets relates to other IB divisions

## Written Guide

### Investment Bank Capital Markets Structure

Investment banks typically organize capital markets into:

**Equity Capital Markets (ECM)**: Helps companies raise equity
- IPOs
- Follow-on offerings
- Convertible securities
- Block trades

**Debt Capital Markets (DCM)**: Helps companies raise debt
- Investment-grade bonds
- High-yield bonds
- Leveraged loans
- Structured products

**Origination**: The coverage/client-facing function that identifies opportunities and wins mandates

### Equity Capital Markets (ECM)

ECM helps companies issue shares to raise equity capital.

**Main Products**:

```calculation
title: "ECM Main Products"
given:
  - "Category: Product and Description"
steps:
  - "IPO: Initial Public Offering — first sale of shares to public"
  - "Follow-On: Additional share sale by already-public company"
  - "Convertible: Bond that converts to equity under certain conditions"
  - "Block Trade: Large secondary sale, often overnight"
  - "SPAC: Special Purpose Acquisition Company (blank-check IPO)"
  - "Rights Offering: Existing shareholders can buy new shares pro-rata"
result: "ECM products range from IPOs for new public companies to block trades for secondary sales"
```

### The IPO Process

**Phase 1: Preparation (3-6 months before)**
- Hire investment banks (lead underwriters)
- Select legal counsel and auditors
- Begin SEC registration process
- Draft prospectus (S-1 in the US)

**Phase 2: Due Diligence**
- Banks conduct thorough review
- Financial, legal, business diligence
- Identify key risks and disclosures
- Prepare management for public company life

**Phase 3: Marketing (2-3 weeks before pricing)**
- File prospectus publicly
- Launch roadshow (management presentations)
- Build book of investor orders
- Gauge demand and price sensitivity

**Phase 4: Pricing and Allocation**
- Set final price based on demand
- Allocate shares to investors
- Price typically set night before trading

**Phase 5: Trading and Stabilization**
- Stock begins trading on exchange
- Underwriters may stabilize price (buy to support)
- Quiet period restrictions on communications

### Follow-On Offerings

Companies already public can issue more shares:

**Primary Offering**: Company sells new shares; proceeds to company
**Secondary Offering**: Existing shareholders sell; proceeds to them
**Mixed**: Combination of primary and secondary

**Overnight Deals**: Faster process for known issuers
- Announcement after market close
- Priced overnight
- Trading next morning

### Debt Capital Markets (DCM)

DCM helps companies issue bonds and other debt.

**Main Products**:

```calculation
title: "DCM Main Products"
given:
  - "Category: Product, Description, Typical Issuer"
steps:
  - "Investment-Grade Bonds: High credit quality (BBB- or above) — Large corporations"
  - "High-Yield Bonds: Below investment grade (BB+ or below) — Leveraged companies, LBOs"
  - "Leveraged Loans: Bank debt for leveraged borrowers — PE portfolio companies"
  - "Commercial Paper: Short-term unsecured debt — Large corps for working capital"
  - "Municipal Bonds: Debt issued by governments — Cities, states, agencies"
  - "Structured Products: ABS, MBS, CLOs — Financial institutions"
result: "DCM products span from investment-grade bonds to structured products, serving diverse issuer needs"
```

### The Bond Issuance Process

**1. Mandate and Structure**
- Issuer selects banks (bookrunners)
- Determine size, maturity, structure
- Investment grade vs. high yield affects process

**2. Documentation**
- Prepare offering memorandum
- Negotiate indenture (bond contract)
- Rating agency presentations

**3. Marketing**
- Investment grade: Often "drive-by" (quick, minimal marketing)
- High yield: Roadshow similar to equity

**4. Bookbuilding**
- Announce initial price guidance (spread over benchmark)
- Collect investor orders
- Tighten pricing based on demand

**5. Pricing and Allocation**
- Set final coupon and price
- Allocate to investors
- Settle (T+2 typically)

### Leveraged Finance

**Leveraged loans** and **high-yield bonds** finance LBOs and leveraged transactions:

**Key Differences from Investment Grade**:

```calculation
title: "Investment Grade vs. Leveraged Finance"
given:
  - "Comparing Investment Grade and Leveraged Finance across key dimensions"
steps:
  - "Credit Rating: IG = BBB- or above | LevFin = BB+ or below"
  - "Spread: IG = Low (100-200 bps) | LevFin = High (300-600+ bps)"
  - "Covenants: IG = Minimal | LevFin = Extensive"
  - "Marketing: IG = Quick | LevFin = Full roadshow"
  - "Investor Base: IG = Insurance, pensions | LevFin = CLOs, hedge funds"
  - "Bank Commitment: IG = Rarely hold | LevFin = Often syndicate"
result: "Leveraged finance carries higher spreads, more covenants, and requires more extensive marketing than investment grade"
```

### Origination

**Origination** is the business development function that sources deals:

**Responsibilities**:
- Build relationships with corporate issuers
- Identify financing needs
- Pitch capital markets solutions
- Win mandates
- Coordinate with ECM/DCM execution

**Origination vs. Coverage**:

In some banks, origination sits in capital markets. In others, **industry coverage** bankers (M&A focused) source capital markets deals alongside advisory work.

**The Pitch**:
- Market update (conditions, comparable deals)
- Proposed structure and timing
- Execution capabilities
- Fees

### Underwriting and Risk

**Underwriting** means the bank commits to purchase securities from the issuer:

**Firm Commitment**: Bank guarantees to buy all securities at agreed price
- Bank takes risk if can't sell to investors
- Most common for large deals

**Best Efforts**: Bank agrees to sell as much as possible
- Issuer takes risk of underselling
- Common for smaller or riskier deals

**Bought Deal**: Bank purchases entire offering immediately
- Highest risk for bank
- Requires strong confidence in demand

### Economics: Capital Markets Fees

**ECM Fees** (as % of proceeds):

```calculation
title: "ECM Fee Structure"
given:
  - "Fees expressed as percentage of proceeds"
steps:
  - "IPO: 5-7%"
  - "Follow-On: 2-4%"
  - "Block Trade: 1-2%"
  - "Convertible: 2-3%"
result: "IPOs command the highest ECM fees at 5-7% of proceeds"
```

**DCM Fees** (as % of proceeds):

```calculation
title: "DCM Fee Structure"
given:
  - "Fees expressed as percentage of proceeds"
steps:
  - "Investment-Grade Bond: 0.2-0.5%"
  - "High-Yield Bond: 1.5-2.5%"
  - "Leveraged Loan: 1-2%"
result: "DCM fees are lower per dollar but volumes are much higher"
```

### Relationship with Other Divisions

**Coverage/M&A**: Often sources capital markets opportunities alongside advisory
- M&A deal needs financing? Bring in ECM/DCM
- Client relationship owned by coverage

**Sales & Trading**: Distributes securities to investors
- ECM/DCM structures; S&T sells
- Feedback from S&T on investor appetite

**Research**: Provides analysis and recommendations
- Equity research coverage important for IPOs
- Credit research for bond deals

### Global Markets / Sales & Trading

While ECM and DCM are "origination" (issuance), **Sales & Trading** handles secondary markets:

**Sales**: Maintains investor relationships, pitches ideas
**Trading**: Executes trades, provides market liquidity, manages risk

Capital markets bankers work with S&T to:
- Gauge investor demand before deals
- Distribute securities during offerings
- Provide aftermarket support

### Interview Relevance

Knowing ECM/DCM shows understanding of the full investment bank:

**Common Questions**:
- "Walk me through an IPO"
- "What's the difference between ECM and DCM?"
- "How does a bond issuance work?"
- "What's the relationship between capital markets and M&A?"

**Why It Matters**:
- Many deals involve capital markets components
- Shows commercial awareness
- Demonstrates you understand how banks make money
