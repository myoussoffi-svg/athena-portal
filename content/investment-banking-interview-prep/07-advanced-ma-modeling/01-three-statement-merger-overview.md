# Three-Statement Merger Model Overview

## Learning Objectives

- Understand why full three-statement merger models are used in live deals
- Distinguish between simple accretion/dilution analysis and full integration models
- Know the key components and workflow of a merger model
- Understand when bankers build full merger models vs. simpler analyses

## Written Guide

### Why Build a Full Merger Model?

In the M&A Accretion/Dilution lesson, you learned the basics: combine earnings, adjust for deal costs and synergies, and see if EPS goes up or down. That analysis answers one question: "Is the deal accretive?"

But real M&A transactions require deeper analysis:

- **How will the combined company's balance sheet look?** Can it support the debt used to fund the deal?
- **What are the credit metrics post-close?** Will the combined company maintain investment-grade ratings?
- **How much leverage can the deal structure support?** What's the maximum purchase price?
- **What financing mix optimizes returns?** 50% cash / 50% stock vs. other structures?
- **How do synergies affect value creation over time?** Not just Year 1, but across the projection period?

A **three-statement merger model** integrates the acquirer and target's income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements. This full integration provides the analytical foundation for deal structuring and negotiation.

### When to Use a Full Merger Model

**Use Full Model When**:
- Advising on a live transaction (buy-side or sell-side)
- Evaluating significant debt financing
- Credit analysis is important (investment grade vs. high yield)
- Multiple financing scenarios need comparison
- Board presentations requiring detailed support

**Use Simple Accretion/Dilution When**:
- Quick screening of potential targets
- Interview questions (unless asked for full model)
- Initial strategic assessment
- Time-constrained analysis

### Components of a Three-Statement Merger Model

**1. Standalone Forecasts**

Separate three-statement models for:
- Acquirer (buyer)
- Target (seller)

These should be independent, working models before any deal adjustments.

**2. Transaction Assumptions**

- Purchase price (offer price or EV)
- Consideration mix (cash vs. stock vs. assumed debt)
- Transaction fees (advisory, financing, legal)
- Expected synergies (revenue and cost)
- Financing terms (debt rates, share issuance price)

**3. Sources and Uses**

Where the money comes from (sources) and where it goes (uses):

**Sources**:
- Cash on hand
- New debt issuance
- New equity issuance

**Uses**:
- Purchase equity value
- Refinance target debt (if applicable)
- Transaction fees
- Cash to balance sheet

Sources must equal uses.

**4. Purchase Price Allocation (PPA)**

Allocate the purchase price to:
- Fair value of acquired assets
- Fair value of assumed liabilities
- Identifiable intangible assets
- Goodwill (the plug)

This determines what goes on the combined balance sheet.

**5. Pro Forma Adjustments**

Adjustments to create the combined entity:
- Eliminate target's historical equity
- Add goodwill and intangibles from PPA
- Add deal-related debt
- Add new acquirer shares (if stock deal)
- Record transaction fees
- Phase in synergies

**6. Consolidated Financial Statements**

Combined income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement showing the merged entity.

**7. Analysis Outputs**

- Accretion/dilution by year
- Credit metrics (Debt/EBITDA, Interest Coverage)
- Return metrics (ROIC, IRR if relevant)
- Sensitivity tables

### The Merger Model Workflow

**Step 1: Build or Obtain Standalone Models**

Start with working models for both companies. These should be fully integrated three-statement models with proper forecasts.

**Step 2: Set Up Transaction Assumptions**

Create an assumptions section with all deal inputs:
- Offer price per share or total equity value
- Premium to current price
- Consideration mix
- Financing terms
- Synergy estimates
- Fee assumptions

**Step 3: Build Sources and Uses**

Calculate total uses (purchase price + fees + refinancing), then build sources to match. This determines how much debt and equity is needed.

**Step 4: Complete Purchase Price Allocation**

Determine goodwill and any fair value adjustments. This requires understanding the target's assets and market values.

**Step 5: Create Pro Forma Balance Sheet**

Combine the two balance sheets with all deal adjustments. Verify it balances on Day 1 (transaction close).

**Step 6: Build Consolidated Income Statement**

Combine revenue, costs, and layer in synergies. Adjust for new interest expense and shares outstanding.

**Step 7: Build Consolidated Cash Flow and Connect Statements**

Derive cash flow from the combined income statement and balance sheet. Ensure all three statements link properly.

**Step 8: Calculate Outputs**

Build accretion/dilution, credit metrics, and sensitivity tables.

### Key Differences from Simple Accretion/Dilution

```calculation
title: "Key Differences: Simple Analysis vs. Full Merger Model"
given:
  - "Aspect: Statements — Simple Analysis: Income statement only | Full Merger Model: All three statements"
  - "Aspect: Balance sheet — Simple Analysis: Ignored | Full Merger Model: Fully integrated"
  - "Aspect: Debt capacity — Simple Analysis: Assumed | Full Merger Model: Calculated from cash flows"
steps:
  - "Aspect: Credit metrics — Simple Analysis: Not modeled | Full Merger Model: Debt/EBITDA, Coverage"
  - "Aspect: Synergies — Simple Analysis: Single estimate | Full Merger Model: Phased over time"
  - "Aspect: Time horizon — Simple Analysis: Year 1 only | Full Merger Model: Multi-year projection"
result: "Full merger models provide comprehensive deal analysis across all financial dimensions"
```

### What Makes a Good Merger Model?

**Flexibility**: Easy to toggle between scenarios (all cash, all stock, mixed), change purchase price, adjust synergies.

**Transparency**: Clear separation between acquirer standalone, target standalone, deal adjustments, and combined.

**Accuracy**: All three statements balance and link; no errors in consolidation.

**Auditability**: Someone else can trace any number back to its source.

### Common Model Tabs/Sections

Typical merger model organization:

1. **Cover / Summary** — Key outputs, scenario selector
2. **Assumptions** — All transaction inputs
3. **Sources & Uses** — Funding structure
4. **PPA & Goodwill** — Purchase price allocation
5. **Acquirer Model** — Standalone financials
6. **Target Model** — Standalone financials
7. **Pro Forma Adjustments** — Deal adjustments by statement
8. **Combined IS** — Consolidated income statement
9. **Combined BS** — Consolidated balance sheet
10. **Combined CF** — Consolidated cash flow
11. **Credit Analysis** — Leverage and coverage ratios
12. **Accretion/Dilution** — EPS analysis
13. **Sensitivities** — Data tables

### Interview Context

In interviews, you won't build a full model, but you should:

- Understand the workflow and components
- Know what a sources and uses table looks like
- Explain how purchase price allocation works
- Discuss why credit analysis matters in M&A

Advanced questions might ask:
- "Walk me through how you'd structure a merger model"
- "What's the difference between a simple accretion/dilution and a full merger model?"
- "How do you determine how much debt the combined company can support?"
