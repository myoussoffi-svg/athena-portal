# How the Three Statements Link Together

## Learning Objectives

- Explain how the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement connect
- Walk through the mechanics of how changes on one statement affect the others
- Demonstrate understanding by answering "walk me through" questions involving transactions
- Identify the specific line items that serve as linkages between statements

## Written Guide

### Why This Question Is Asked

"Walk me through how the three statements link" is one of the most common technical questions in IB interviews. It tests whether you truly understand financial statements or have simply memorized definitions. Strong candidates can explain the connections clearly and apply this knowledge to hypothetical transactions.

This question also sets up follow-on scenarios like "If revenue increases by $100, walk me through the impact on all three statements" or "What happens if a company buys $50 of equipment with cash?"

### The Core Linkages

The three statements are connected through several key relationships:

1. **Net income** on the income statement flows into **retained earnings** on the balance sheet
2. **Net income** is also the starting point for the cash flow statement (in the operating section)
3. **Depreciation** reduces net income on the income statement, reduces PP&E on the balance sheet, and is added back in cash flow from operations
4. **Capital expenditures (CapEx)** appear in cash flow from investing and increase PP&E on the balance sheet
5. **Changes in working capital accounts** (receivables, inventory, payables) on the balance sheet affect cash flow from operations
6. **Debt and equity issuances or repayments** appear in cash flow from financing and affect the corresponding accounts on the balance sheet
7. **The net change in cash** from the cash flow statement equals the change in the cash account on the balance sheet

### Walking Through the Connections Step by Step

**Step 1: Income Statement to Balance Sheet**

Net income from the income statement increases **retained earnings** on the balance sheet. If a company earns $100 in net income, retained earnings increase by $100 (assuming no dividends).

Dividends, if paid, reduce retained earnings. If the company pays $20 in dividends, retained earnings increase by $80 ($100 net income - $20 dividends).

**Step 2: Income Statement to Cash Flow Statement**

The cash flow statement begins with **net income** in the cash flow from operations section. However, net income is accrual-based, so we must adjust for non-cash items and changes in working capital to arrive at cash generated from operations.

**Step 3: Adjusting for Non-Cash Items**

**Depreciation** is a non-cash expense that reduces net income on the income statement. Since no cash actually left the company, we add it back in the cash flow statement.

For example, if net income is $100 and depreciation is $20, cash flow from operations starts at $100 and adds back $20.

Depreciation also reduces the book value of PP&E on the balance sheet.

**Step 4: Adjusting for Changes in Working Capital**

Changes in current assets and liabilities affect cash flow:

- **Increase in receivables**: Revenue was recognized, but cash hasn't been collected yet. This is a use of cash, so we subtract the increase from cash flow from operations.
- **Increase in inventory**: Cash was used to buy inventory that hasn't been sold yet. This is a use of cash.
- **Increase in payables**: The company incurred an expense but hasn't paid it yet. This is a source of cash, so we add the increase.

These changes reconcile the accrual-based income statement with actual cash movements.

**Step 5: Cash Flow from Investing**

**CapEx** (purchases of PP&E) is a use of cash and appears as a negative number in cash flow from investing. CapEx also increases PP&E on the balance sheet.

Over time, PP&E is reduced by depreciation, which flows through the income statement.

**Step 6: Cash Flow from Financing**

Debt issuances increase cash and increase debt on the balance sheet. Debt repayments reduce cash and reduce debt on the balance sheet.

Dividends paid reduce cash and reduce retained earnings.

**Step 7: Net Change in Cash**

The sum of cash flow from operations, investing, and financing equals the **net change in cash**. This change must equal the difference between the cash balance at the beginning and end of the period on the balance sheet.

### Example Walkthrough: Revenue Increases by $100

This is a classic interview question. Here's how to walk through it:

**Assumptions**: The revenue is collected in cash, and there are no other changes (no COGS, no expenses, no taxes for simplicity).

**Income Statement**:
- Revenue increases by $100
- Net income increases by $100 (assuming no expenses or taxes)

**Balance Sheet**:
- Cash increases by $100 (asset)
- Retained earnings increase by $100 (equity)
- The balance sheet balances: +$100 assets = +$100 equity

**Cash Flow Statement**:
- Cash flow from operations increases by $100 (starting with net income of $100)
- Net change in cash is +$100, which matches the change in cash on the balance sheet

In reality, interviewers will add complexity (e.g., "What if 50% of the revenue is on credit?" or "What if there's a 30% tax rate?"), and you need to adjust accordingly.

### Example Walkthrough: Company Buys $50 of Equipment with Cash

**Income Statement**:
- No immediate impact (CapEx is not an expense; it's capitalized on the balance sheet)

**Balance Sheet**:
- Cash decreases by $50 (asset)
- PP&E increases by $50 (asset)
- The balance sheet balances: -$50 cash + $50 PP&E = 0 net change to total assets

**Cash Flow Statement**:
- Cash flow from investing decreases by $50 (CapEx is a use of cash)
- Net change in cash is -$50, which matches the change in cash on the balance sheet

Over time, the equipment will be depreciated, which will flow through the income statement and reduce PP&E on the balance sheet.

### Common Mistakes

**Forgetting to adjust for non-cash items**: Depreciation, stock-based compensation, and other non-cash charges must be added back in the cash flow statement.

**Confusing revenue with cash**: If revenue is on credit, it increases receivables, not cash. You must adjust for the change in receivables in cash flow from operations.

**Not balancing the balance sheet**: Every transaction must keep the balance sheet in balance. If assets increase by $100, either liabilities or equity must also increase by $100 (or another asset must decrease by $100).

**Ignoring taxes**: In more complex scenarios, interviewers may ask you to account for taxes. If so, net income must be calculated after tax, and cash flow from operations must reflect the tax payment.

## Key Takeaways

- Net income flows to retained earnings on the balance sheet and is the starting point for the cash flow statement
- Depreciation reduces net income and PP&E but is added back in cash flow from operations because it's non-cash
- Changes in working capital (receivables, inventory, payables) reconcile accrual-based income with cash flow
- CapEx appears in cash flow from investing and increases PP&E on the balance sheet
- The net change in cash from the cash flow statement must equal the change in the cash account on the balance sheet
- Practice walking through transactions step-by-step to ensure the balance sheet always balances
