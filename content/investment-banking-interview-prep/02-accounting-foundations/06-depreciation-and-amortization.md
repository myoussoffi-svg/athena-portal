# Depreciation and Amortization

## Learning Objectives

- Explain what depreciation and amortization are and why they exist
- Understand how D&A affects the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement
- Distinguish between different depreciation methods and when each is used
- Answer interview questions involving changes in D&A and their impact on financial statements

## Written Guide

### What Are Depreciation and Amortization?

**Depreciation** is the allocation of the cost of a tangible long-lived asset (like equipment, buildings, or vehicles) over its useful life. Instead of expensing the full cost when the asset is purchased, the cost is spread over the years the asset is used.

**Amortization** is the same concept, but for intangible assets like patents, trademarks, customer relationships, or acquired technology.

Both are **non-cash expenses**. The company spent cash when it bought the asset, but the expense is recognized over time on the income statement. No cash leaves the company when depreciation or amortization is recorded.

### Why D&A Exists

D&A exists because of the **matching principle** in accounting: expenses should be recognized in the same period as the revenue they help generate. A piece of machinery that will be used for 10 years shouldn't be fully expensed in year one. Instead, its cost is spread over its useful life.

For example, if a company buys a machine for $100,000 with a 10-year useful life, it might depreciate $10,000 per year ($100,000 / 10 years). This matches the cost of the asset with the revenue it helps produce each year.

### How D&A Affects the Three Statements

**Income Statement**:
- D&A is an operating expense that reduces EBIT and net income
- However, because it's non-cash, it does not reduce cash flow

**Balance Sheet**:
- Depreciation reduces the book value of PP&E (shown as "Accumulated Depreciation," a contra-asset account)
- Amortization reduces the book value of intangible assets
- Over time, the net value of these assets declines

**Cash Flow Statement**:
- D&A is added back in cash flow from operations because it's a non-cash expense
- The actual cash outflow occurred when the asset was purchased (recorded as CapEx in cash flow from investing)

**Example**:
A company buys equipment for $100 cash and depreciates it $10/year.

Year 1:
- **Income Statement**: D&A expense of $10 reduces EBIT and net income
- **Balance Sheet**: PP&E (net) decreases by $10 (from $100 to $90), cash decreased by $100 when purchased
- **Cash Flow Statement**: Net income is reduced by $10, but $10 is added back in CFO because it's non-cash. CapEx of $100 appears in CFI.

Net impact on cash: -$100 (from CapEx), not from the depreciation expense.

### Depreciation Methods

There are several methods for calculating depreciation:

**1. Straight-Line Depreciation (most common for financial reporting)**:
- Annual Depreciation = (Cost - Salvage Value) / Useful Life
- Example: $100,000 asset, $10,000 salvage value, 10-year life → $9,000/year

**2. Accelerated Depreciation (e.g., Double Declining Balance)**:
- Depreciation is higher in early years and lower in later years
- Used for tax purposes in the U.S. (MACRS) to defer taxes

**3. Units of Production**:
- Depreciation based on usage (e.g., miles driven, units produced)
- Common for manufacturing equipment or vehicles

For interview purposes, focus on **straight-line depreciation**, as it's the simplest and most common in financial reporting.

### Tax vs. Book Depreciation

Companies often use different depreciation methods for financial reporting (book) vs. taxes:

- **Book depreciation**: Typically straight-line, shown on the income statement
- **Tax depreciation**: Accelerated (e.g., MACRS in the U.S.), to reduce taxable income and defer taxes

This creates **deferred tax liabilities** on the balance sheet because the company pays less tax now but will owe more later when tax depreciation slows down.

### Interview Question: "If Depreciation Increases by $10, What Happens to the Three Statements?"

**Assumptions**: Higher depreciation, all else equal, no tax impact for simplicity.

**Income Statement**:
- D&A expense increases by $10
- EBIT decreases by $10
- Net income decreases by $10 (or $7 if you account for a 30% tax rate: $10 × (1 - 30%) = $7 decline)

**Cash Flow Statement**:
- Net income decreases by $10 (or $7 after tax)
- D&A is added back, so the add-back increases by $10
- Net effect on CFO: $0 (the decrease in net income is offset by the higher add-back)
- No impact on cash

**Balance Sheet**:
- PP&E (net) decreases by $10 due to higher accumulated depreciation (asset side)
- Retained earnings decrease by $10 (or $7 after tax) due to lower net income (equity side)
- If no tax: -$10 assets = -$10 equity. If with tax: -$10 assets, +$3 deferred tax liability, -$7 equity.

**Key insight**: Higher depreciation reduces net income and the book value of assets, but it does not affect cash flow.

### Common Mistakes

**Thinking depreciation affects cash**: Depreciation is a non-cash expense. It reduces net income, but the cash outflow happened when the asset was purchased (CapEx).

**Confusing depreciation with CapEx**: CapEx is the cash purchase of an asset; depreciation is the non-cash expense that allocates that cost over time.

**Forgetting to add back D&A in the cash flow statement**: D&A reduces net income, so it must be added back to arrive at cash flow from operations.

**Not understanding deferred taxes**: If a company uses accelerated depreciation for taxes, it creates a deferred tax liability, which affects the balance sheet.

## Key Takeaways

- Depreciation (tangible assets) and amortization (intangible assets) allocate the cost of long-lived assets over their useful life
- D&A is a non-cash expense: it reduces net income but not cash flow
- D&A reduces EBIT on the income statement, reduces asset book value on the balance sheet, and is added back in CFO on the cash flow statement
- Straight-line depreciation is most common for financial reporting; accelerated depreciation is used for taxes
- Higher depreciation reduces net income and book value of assets, but does not affect cash flow
