# Comparable Transactions and Valuation Context

Valuation in private equity differs fundamentally from academic exercises. You are not calculating intrinsic value from first principles. You are determining whether a proposed price, negotiated through a competitive process, is reasonable given market conditions and comparable transactions. Your case study must demonstrate this practical orientation to valuation.

## The Market-Based Approach

Private equity valuation is inherently market-referenced. When a PE firm pays 10x EBITDA for a company, they are implicitly saying: given what other buyers have paid for similar assets, given where public comparables trade, and given our view of exit market conditions, 10x represents a price at which we can generate acceptable returns.

This market-based approach has important implications. You cannot evaluate whether a price is "correct" in isolation. You can only evaluate whether it is reasonable relative to relevant benchmarks and whether it supports attractive returns given your projections. A price that generates a 25% IRR is not "too high" simply because you could theoretically have paid less. It is evaluated against alternatives and risk-adjusted return requirements.

Your case study analysis should embrace this market orientation. Reference comparable transactions, public trading multiples, and market conditions rather than attempting standalone intrinsic value calculations.

## Using Precedent Transactions

Precedent transaction analysis examines prices paid in recent M&A involving similar companies. This directly answers the question: what have buyers actually paid for companies like this one?

When selecting comparable transactions, prioritize relevance over recency. A transaction from two years ago involving a company in the same subsector with similar characteristics provides more useful information than a transaction from last month in an adjacent space. That said, transactions more than three years old may reflect different market conditions and should be weighted less heavily.

Consider deal context when interpreting precedent multiples. Strategic buyers often pay premiums for synergy potential that financial buyers cannot justify. Auction processes typically generate higher prices than negotiated transactions. Distressed sales reflect discount pricing. A precedent transaction at 12x EBITDA tells you less without understanding whether it was a competitive auction won by a strategic buyer with significant synergies.

Extract relevant metrics from your precedent set. For most PE cases, EV/EBITDA multiples are the primary metric. But also examine EV/Revenue for high-growth companies where profitability is depressed, and consider leverage levels and return profiles when data is available.

## Using Public Trading Comparables

Public company trading multiples provide a different valuation reference. Where precedent transactions show what buyers have paid for control, public comparables show what investors pay for minority stakes with daily liquidity.

The gap between these references matters. Control premiums - the difference between acquisition prices and public trading multiples - typically range from 20% to 40%. If public comparables trade at 8x EBITDA, implied control values might range from 10x to 11x. This provides a reasonability check on proposed acquisition prices.

Select public comparables carefully. The best comparables share business model characteristics, end market exposure, growth profile, and profitability level with your target company. Pure-play comparables in the same subsector are ideal. Conglomerate divisions or companies with significant different business mixes provide noisier signals.

Adjust for differences when interpreting trading multiples. A public comparable growing 20% annually trading at 12x EBITDA tells you little about fair value for your target growing 5% annually. Regression analysis relating multiples to growth, margins, or other fundamental characteristics can help, but often simple qualitative adjustment suffices for case study purposes.

## Triangulating Valuation

Sophisticated valuation analysis triangulates across multiple approaches rather than relying on any single method.

Start with precedent transactions to establish what buyers have actually paid. Identify the range and consider where within that range your target company should sit based on its specific characteristics. A higher-quality company with better growth merits the upper end; a lower-quality company with challenges merits the lower end.

Check against public trading comparables plus a control premium. If this implies a significantly different range than precedent transactions, investigate why. Perhaps market conditions have changed. Perhaps your comparable selection needs refinement. Perhaps there are company-specific factors justifying deviation.

Validate against your LBO returns analysis. A price that supports your target returns - typically 20-25% IRR - is acceptable. A price where even optimistic assumptions yield inadequate returns is too high, regardless of what comparable analysis suggests.

Where these approaches converge, you have confidence in your valuation view. Where they diverge, investigate the reasons and determine which approach is most relevant for your specific situation.

## Assessing the Proposed Price

Your case study will typically provide a proposed price or range. Your job is to assess whether this price is reasonable.

If the proposed price falls within your comparable transaction range and supports attractive returns, proceed with confidence. Your recommendation can affirm the price: "The proposed entry multiple of 9.5x EBITDA falls within the range of 9-11x observed in recent comparable transactions and supports a 24% IRR under our base case assumptions."

If the proposed price falls above your comparable range, you must justify the premium. Perhaps the target company has superior characteristics - faster growth, higher margins, stronger market position - that merit premium valuation. Perhaps your thesis involves value creation that transforms the business into a higher-valued profile. Articulate this justification explicitly.

If the proposed price exceeds a justifiable level, recommend negotiation or passing. Quantify the impact: "At 11x EBITDA, base case IRR falls to 18%, below our target threshold. We would recommend negotiating to 10x or below to achieve acceptable returns. If the seller is firm at 11x, we should pass."

## Exit Multiple Assumptions

Entry valuation matters, but exit valuation matters equally for return generation. Your case study must address exit multiple assumptions with the same rigor as entry multiple analysis.

Conservative practice assumes exit multiple at or below entry multiple. If you enter at 10x, assuming exit at 10x or 9.5x is defensible. Assuming exit at 12x requires specific justification - perhaps a transformation thesis, perhaps historical evidence that similar companies have exited at premium multiples.

Consider what drives exit multiples. Growth rate at exit matters - companies growing faster command higher multiples. Margin profile affects valuation. Market positioning and strategic appeal influence buyer willingness to pay. Your thesis should address which of these factors you expect to be favorable at exit.

Stress test exit assumptions. Calculate returns assuming exit multiple compression of one or two turns. If your investment only works with multiple expansion, the downside risk may be unacceptable.

## Presenting Valuation Analysis

In your case study presentation, valuation analysis should support your recommendation rather than dominate it.

Present valuation concisely: "Comparable transactions suggest a fair value range of 9-11x EBITDA. The proposed entry multiple of 10x falls within this range. Given the company's above-average growth and margin profile, I believe 10x is appropriate. At this entry level, my base case analysis generates a 24% IRR with 17% in downside scenarios, supporting my recommendation to invest."

Connect valuation to your broader thesis. Entry multiple is not evaluated in isolation but rather as one input into an integrated investment recommendation. Keep valuation in its proper context as you present your case.
