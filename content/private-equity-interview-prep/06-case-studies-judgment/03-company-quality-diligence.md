# Company Quality Assessment and Diligence Priorities

Once you understand the industry context, you must evaluate the specific company within that context. This is where many banking analysts struggle in PE interviews. You know how to analyze financial statements and build models. But can you look at a business and form a judgment about its quality? Can you distinguish a genuinely advantaged company from one that merely appears successful due to favorable timing or unsustainable practices?

## Defining Quality in PE Context

Quality, for our purposes, means predictability and defensibility of cash flows. A high-quality business generates consistent earnings that are difficult for competitors to disrupt. A low-quality business generates earnings that depend on factors outside management control or face constant competitive erosion.

The distinction matters enormously for private equity returns. With a high-quality business, you can confidently underwrite baseline performance and focus value creation efforts on incremental improvements. With a low-quality business, baseline performance is uncertain, making your value creation plan a race against potential deterioration.

Quality is not the same as profitability. A company can be highly profitable today while possessing low quality - if that profitability stems from temporary factors, unsustainable pricing, or competitive dynamics about to shift. Your job is to distinguish current results from sustainable earning power.

## The Moat Assessment

Warren Buffett popularized the concept of economic moats - durable competitive advantages that protect a company from competitive encroachment. In your case study analysis, identifying and evaluating moats is essential.

The strongest moats include network effects, where the product becomes more valuable as more customers use it. Switching costs, where customers face real pain in changing vendors, provide another durable advantage. Scale economies, where the largest players have structural cost advantages, protect market leaders in certain industries. Proprietary technology or intellectual property can create differentiation that competitors cannot easily replicate.

Weaker moats include brand awareness, which can erode over time, and customer relationships, which often depend on specific individuals rather than structural lock-in. Lowest price positioning is almost never a sustainable moat - someone can always choose to lose more money than you.

When assessing a case study company, ask yourself: if a well-capitalized competitor decided to attack this company's market position, what would prevent them from succeeding? If the answer is "nothing much," the moat is weak.

## Revenue Quality Analysis

Not all revenue is created equal. In assessing company quality, decompose revenue into components and evaluate each.

Recurring revenue - subscriptions, long-term contracts, maintenance agreements - represents the highest quality. These revenue streams persist absent customer action, providing predictability and reducing customer acquisition costs. Non-recurring revenue from one-time projects or transactions is lower quality, requiring constant sales effort to maintain.

Customer concentration creates fragility. If the top three customers represent more than thirty percent of revenue, losing any single relationship could materially impair the business. In your case study, calculate concentration metrics and consider them a risk factor requiring specific mitigation.

Revenue durability across economic cycles indicates quality. Companies whose revenue dropped sharply during past recessions may repeat that pattern. Companies whose revenue proved resilient - perhaps because they sell essential services or have contractual protections - offer more predictability.

## Margin Sustainability

High margins can indicate competitive advantage, but they can also indicate temporary conditions about to normalize. Your diligence must distinguish between the two.

Investigate why margins are at their current level. Do they reflect proprietary technology, scale economies, or pricing power - sustainable sources? Or do they reflect favorable input costs, temporary supply constraints, or lack of competition - conditions likely to change?

Margin trends matter as much as absolute levels. Expanding margins often indicate improving competitive position or successful execution. Contracting margins may signal emerging competitive pressure or cost inflation the company cannot pass through. Stable margins over extended periods suggest genuine equilibrium.

Compare margins to competitors and industry benchmarks. A company significantly above industry norms either possesses real competitive advantages or benefits from circumstances that will eventually normalize. Understand which applies.

## Management and Organizational Capability

PE firms change management more often than people realize. But you still need to assess the current team, both because they know the business and because their capabilities indicate organizational health.

Look for track record of execution. Has this team delivered on past initiatives? Have they grown the business, improved margins, successfully integrated acquisitions? Or have they missed projections, failed initiatives, and blamed external factors? Past behavior predicts future performance.

Assess management depth beyond the CEO. If the CEO departs, is there succession? Are functional leaders capable of operating independently? Organizations dependent on a single individual carry concentration risk similar to customer concentration.

Consider alignment of incentives. Management teams with significant equity ownership behave differently than hired operators. Understanding compensation structures helps predict behavior.

## Diligence Prioritization

In a time-constrained case study, you cannot investigate everything. Effective prioritization separates strong candidates from weak ones.

Focus diligence on factors that could break the investment thesis. If your thesis depends on margin expansion, deeply investigate margin sustainability and expansion potential. If your thesis depends on market growth, rigorously examine the growth assumptions. If your thesis depends on acquisition execution, assess the track record and pipeline.

Conversely, spend less time on factors that do not materially affect your investment decision. Operational details that affect returns by tens of basis points matter less than strategic factors that affect returns by hundreds.

The best case study candidates demonstrate this prioritization explicitly. They explain what they investigated deeply and why, what they would investigate with more time, and what they deliberately deprioritized. This shows sophisticated judgment about what matters.

## Synthesizing Quality Assessment

Conclude your quality assessment with a clear judgment. Is this a high-quality business where you have confidence in baseline cash flows? A medium-quality business where execution risk exists but upside potential compensates? Or a low-quality business where fundamental challenges make attractive returns unlikely?

This judgment directly affects your valuation perspective and recommendation. High-quality businesses merit higher multiples and more aggressive assumptions. Low-quality businesses require discounts and conservative underwriting. Your assessment of quality should flow directly into your investment thesis and risk analysis.
