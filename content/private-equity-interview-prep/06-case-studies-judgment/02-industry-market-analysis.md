# Industry and Market Analysis

Before you can evaluate whether a company is a good investment, you must understand whether its industry allows good investments to exist. I have seen brilliant operators run companies into the ground because the industry structure made sustained profitability impossible. Conversely, I have seen mediocre management teams generate excellent returns simply by participating in a structurally attractive industry. Your first analytical priority in any case study is understanding the playing field.

## Why Industry Trumps Company

The single most predictive factor in private equity returns is not management quality or operational execution - it is industry selection. Academic research consistently demonstrates that industry characteristics explain more variance in company profitability than company-specific factors. This does not mean company quality is irrelevant, but it does mean you should always start your analysis at the industry level.

When evaluating a case study, ask yourself: Would I want to own any company in this industry? If the answer is no - if the industry structure commoditizes returns, if customers have overwhelming bargaining power, if new entrants continuously erode market share - then your target company needs extraordinary characteristics to overcome those headwinds. More often, you should simply pass.

## The TAM Question

Every case study touches on market size, and candidates often parrot TAM figures from the CIM without critical analysis. Stop. The total addressable market number tells you almost nothing useful by itself. What matters is whether your specific company can capture a larger share of that market, at attractive margins, over your investment horizon.

The serviceable addressable market - the portion of TAM your company can realistically pursue - matters far more. A $50 billion TAM means nothing if your company operates in a niche geographic region serving a specialized customer segment representing $500 million of that market. Focus your analysis on the relevant market and be specific about the assumptions underlying any growth projections.

Market growth rates require similar scrutiny. Historical growth often differs dramatically from forward projections. Understand what drives growth - is it underlying demand expansion, pricing increases, or share shifts? Each has different implications for sustainability and competitive dynamics.

## Competitive Dynamics Framework

For case study purposes, you need a practical framework for assessing competitive intensity. I use a simplified approach focused on three questions.

First, how fragmented is the market? Fragmented markets with many small players often present consolidation opportunities. Your platform company can acquire competitors, achieve scale economies, and create a larger, more valuable enterprise. Concentrated markets with established oligopolies offer fewer opportunities for share gains and typically feature rational pricing behavior.

Second, what determines competitive success? In some industries, success flows from scale - the largest players have cost advantages that perpetuate their dominance. In others, differentiation drives outcomes - specialized capabilities, customer relationships, or technical expertise matter more than size. Understanding what drives competitive success tells you whether your target company has the right attributes to win.

Third, how do competitors respond to pressure? Industries with rational competitors who maintain price discipline during downturns are far more attractive than industries where desperate players slash prices to maintain volume. One competitor's distress can destroy profitability for everyone.

## Identifying Tailwinds and Headwinds

Every industry faces secular trends that create opportunities or threats over your investment horizon. Your case study analysis must identify and assess these forces.

Tailwinds are structural factors that expand the opportunity set. These might include demographic shifts creating new demand, regulatory changes favoring certain business models, technology adoption curves driving market growth, or macro trends like outsourcing or consolidation. When tailwinds exist, even modest execution creates value.

Headwinds are the opposite - structural forces that compress opportunity. Technology disruption threatens incumbents. Regulatory scrutiny increases costs. Customer preferences shift away from your product category. Demographic changes reduce your addressable market. When headwinds exist, even excellent execution may not overcome the structural pressure.

In your case study, identify the two or three most important secular trends affecting the industry and assess their directional impact. Be specific about timeframes - a headwind arriving in year seven matters less than one arriving in year two.

## The Cyclicality Question

Leveraged buyouts amplify returns in both directions. This makes cyclicality particularly dangerous for PE investments. A company generating $100 million of EBITDA at cycle peak might generate $60 million at cycle trough. With significant debt, that decline can threaten solvency.

Assess where we are in the industry cycle when evaluating your case study. If the company shows peak margins and record revenue, ask yourself what happens when normalization occurs. Underwriting to peak metrics is a common source of PE value destruction.

More defensively positioned industries - those with recurring revenue, essential services, or counter-cyclical characteristics - command premium valuations for good reason. They offer more predictable returns and lower risk of permanent capital impairment.

## Synthesizing Industry Assessment

At the end of your industry analysis, you should be able to make one of three statements. Either: this industry structure supports attractive returns and I am comfortable underwriting growth and margin assumptions. Or: this industry has challenges but the target company has specific advantages that mitigate industry headwinds. Or: this industry structure makes attractive returns unlikely regardless of company quality.

The third conclusion should lead you toward passing on the investment. The first makes your subsequent company analysis more straightforward. The second requires careful examination of whether the company's advantages are real and sustainable.

Your case study presentation should dedicate meaningful time to industry analysis precisely because it shapes every subsequent judgment. Skipping or rushing this section signals shallow thinking.
