# Case Study Frameworks and Structured Approach

The case study is where PE recruiting separates analysts who can execute transactions from those who can evaluate them. Every banking analyst knows how to build an LBO model. Far fewer understand how to look at a business, form a view on its investability, and defend that view under pressure. The case study tests exactly this transition in mindset.

## The Fundamental Shift in Thinking

When you worked on sell-side mandates, your job was to present the company in its best light and find the highest bidder. In private equity, your job is fundamentally different: you are the buyer, and your capital is at risk. This means approaching every opportunity with healthy skepticism. The CIM you receive was written by bankers paid to make the company look attractive. Your task is to see through the marketing and identify what actually matters for generating returns.

The best case study candidates demonstrate what I call "investor paranoia" - they are constantly asking themselves what could go wrong, where the risks hide, and whether the story being presented actually holds together. This does not mean being pessimistic; it means being rigorously honest about both the opportunity and its challenges.

## The Four-Pillar Framework

Every PE case study, whether given one hour or forty-eight, ultimately requires you to answer the same fundamental question: Should we invest at this price? To answer systematically, I recommend organizing your analysis around four pillars.

**Pillar One: Industry Dynamics.** Before evaluating the company itself, understand the water it swims in. Is this an industry with structural tailwinds or headwinds? Are returns available to participants, or does competition erode margins? Understanding industry context shapes every subsequent judgment you make about the company.

**Pillar Two: Company Quality.** Within that industry context, how does this specific business stack up? What are its competitive advantages, if any? How sustainable are they? Quality businesses compound value; mediocre businesses require perfect execution on operational improvements that may or may not materialize.

**Pillar Three: Value Creation Path.** PE returns come from somewhere. You must articulate specifically how this investment generates returns - through revenue growth, margin expansion, multiple expansion, leverage paydown, or some combination. Vague assertions that "we will improve the business" are worthless. Concrete plans with quantified impact demonstrate real investment thinking.

**Pillar Four: Risk and Downside.** Every investment thesis has vulnerabilities. Identifying them proactively demonstrates mature judgment. More importantly, understanding downside scenarios lets you evaluate whether the risk-adjusted return is attractive, not just the base case return.

## Time Allocation Strategy

How you allocate time reveals your judgment. I have seen candidates spend ninety percent of a case study perfecting their LBO model, only to stumble when asked basic questions about the business. The model is a tool, not the answer.

For a take-home case with several days, allocate roughly thirty percent of your time to reading, understanding, and researching the company and industry. Spend another thirty percent building your financial model and running sensitivities. Use twenty-five percent on qualitative analysis - industry dynamics, competitive positioning, risk identification, and thesis construction. Reserve the final fifteen percent for synthesizing your findings into a coherent presentation and refining your recommendation.

For a live case with limited time, the allocation shifts dramatically. You cannot build a comprehensive model, so focus on back-of-envelope analysis and quick returns math. Spend more time - perhaps forty percent - on rapid reading and identification of key issues. The interviewer knows you had limited time; they are evaluating your judgment and prioritization, not your model completeness.

## Structuring Your Deliverable

Whether presenting slides or discussing verbally, structure matters enormously. Lead with your recommendation. Do not make interviewers wait through fifteen minutes of analysis to learn your conclusion. State clearly: "I recommend we invest at this price" or "I would pass on this opportunity because..." Then walk backward through your reasoning.

Your investment thesis should be three to four specific, concrete reasons why this investment generates attractive returns. Not "good company, good industry" - that tells me nothing. Instead: "This investment generates returns through margin expansion from 18% to 22% via procurement consolidation, accelerated growth through tuck-in acquisitions in a fragmented market, and multiple expansion as we demonstrate the recurring nature of the revenue base."

Address risks explicitly. The candidates who pretend risks do not exist are the ones I worry about most. Acknowledge the key risks, quantify their impact where possible, and explain how you would mitigate or monitor them. This demonstrates the balanced thinking that partners value in associates.

## The Recommendation Decision

Your recommendation must be definitive. "It depends" is not acceptable. You have three options: invest at the proposed terms, negotiate for better terms before investing, or pass entirely.

When recommending investment, be specific about what return profile you expect and what conditions must hold for that return to materialize. When recommending negotiation, articulate exactly what terms you want to change and why - typically price, but potentially structure, governance, or other elements. When recommending to pass, explain clearly what would need to change for this to become attractive.

The strongest candidates connect their recommendation back to their framework. They can explain exactly which pillar of their analysis drove them to their conclusion, and how sensitive that conclusion is to key assumptions.

## Building Pattern Recognition

Case study excellence comes from repetition. The first case study you complete will feel overwhelming. By your tenth, you will recognize patterns - the same industry dynamics appear across sectors, the same value creation levers recur, the same risks manifest in similar ways. This pattern recognition allows you to move faster and focus on what actually differentiates each opportunity.

Study past cases, read CIMs, analyze public PE deals, and practice articulating investment theses aloud. The frameworks provide structure, but judgment develops through experience.
