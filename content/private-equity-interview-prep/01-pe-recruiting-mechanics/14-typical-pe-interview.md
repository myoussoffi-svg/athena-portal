# The Typical PE Interview

PE interviews differ significantly from the banking interviews you navigated earlier in your career. Understanding what to expect—the format, the content, and what interviewers actually assess—allows you to prepare effectively and perform at your best when it matters.

## Interview Structure Overview

Most PE interview processes follow a multi-round structure, though the specific format varies by firm. Understanding the general architecture helps you prepare for each phase.

First-round interviews typically combine technical assessment with fit evaluation. You may encounter a modeling test, technical questions about LBO mechanics and valuation, and behavioral questions about your background and interest in PE. These rounds often occur with mid-level professionals—VPs or principals—who assess whether you merit advancement to senior rounds.

Second-round or final-round interviews involve case studies and meetings with senior team members. You will likely receive a company profile or CIM and be asked to analyze the investment opportunity, build a model, and present your recommendation. Partners and managing directors evaluate your thinking, judgment, and fit with the team.

Some firms add additional rounds—dinner conversations, superday formats with multiple interviews, or take-home case studies. The compressed on-cycle timeline means even complex processes unfold quickly, often within days.

What seniors observe is that PE interviews assess fundamentally different things than banking interviews. Banking interviews test whether you can learn the job. PE interviews test whether you can already do the job—or come close enough that development will bridge the gap.

## The Technical Assessment

Technical evaluation is central to PE interviews. Firms need to know that you can execute the analytical work immediately upon starting.

Modeling tests evaluate your ability to build financial models under time pressure. You may receive a paper LBO test, asking you to work through an LBO scenario by hand. Alternatively, you may be given an Excel-based test with a company profile and asked to build a working model in two to three hours. Some firms use hybrid formats.

The paper LBO tests your conceptual understanding. Can you structure an LBO from memory? Do you understand sources and uses, debt schedules, and returns calculations? Can you work through the math without a spreadsheet?

Excel tests assess both conceptual knowledge and execution ability. Can you build a model that works? Is it structured logically? Do you handle the mechanics correctly? Speed matters—these tests are timed.

Technical questions probe understanding beyond modeling. Interviewers may ask about accounting concepts, valuation methodologies, credit analysis, or investment return drivers. They want evidence that you understand finance deeply, not just mechanically.

Common technical topics include LBO mechanics and return drivers, debt capacity and credit statistics, working capital and cash flow, accounting for M&A transactions, comparable company and precedent transaction analysis, and DCF methodology. Preparation should cover all these areas thoroughly.

## The Case Study

Case studies are the signature element of PE interviewing. They simulate the work you will do as an associate, assessing whether you can evaluate an investment opportunity and form a recommendation.

Format varies across firms. Some provide a short company profile and expect an analysis within thirty to sixty minutes. Others provide extensive materials—a full CIM—and expect detailed modeling and a formal presentation. Take-home cases give you more time but expect correspondingly more depth.

Regardless of format, the case assesses several dimensions. Can you identify the key investment considerations—what makes this company attractive or unattractive as an LBO candidate? Can you model the opportunity reasonably, even with limited information? Can you structure your thinking clearly and present it persuasively? Can you handle questions and pushback on your conclusions?

The recommendation matters less than the reasoning. Interviewers are not looking for a specific answer. They want to see how you think about investments. A well-reasoned "no" is better than an unsupported "yes."

What seniors listen for in cases is investment judgment. Technical skills can be taught; judgment takes longer to develop. Candidates who demonstrate thoughtful analysis of risks and opportunities, appropriate skepticism, and clear thinking under pressure stand out.

## Behavioral and Fit Assessment

Beyond technical evaluation, PE interviews probe whether you fit the team and the work.

Deal experience discussions are central. Be prepared to walk through transactions you worked on in detail. What was your role? What were the key issues? What did you learn? Interviewers assess the depth of your involvement and your ability to reflect on experience.

The "why PE" question appears in every process. Your answer must be genuine, specific, and demonstrate understanding of what PE work involves. Generic answers about interesting work or learning opportunities are insufficient.

The "why this firm" question tests your preparation and genuine interest. Reference specific aspects of the firm's strategy, portfolio, or culture. Demonstrate that you have done homework beyond reading the website.

Behavioral questions probe how you handle challenge, conflict, and uncertainty. How do you manage competing priorities? How do you respond to difficult feedback? How do you work with people you disagree with? Answers should draw on concrete examples from your experience.

Cultural fit assessment is often implicit rather than explicit. Interviewers are evaluating whether they want to work with you—whether you would fit into the team, handle the demands, and contribute positively to the environment.

## What Interviewers Actually Assess

Understanding what interviewers evaluate helps you prepare appropriately.

Technical capability is table stakes. You must demonstrate that you can do the analytical work. Weakness here is disqualifying regardless of other strengths.

Investment judgment distinguishes strong candidates. Can you identify what matters in an investment? Can you weigh risks appropriately? Do you think like an investor, not just an analyst?

Communication quality affects every dimension. Can you explain complex ideas clearly? Do you present yourself professionally? Interviewers assess your ability to represent the firm to management teams, lenders, and other stakeholders.

Maturity and self-awareness signal readiness. Can you discuss your weaknesses candidly? Do you take feedback constructively? Do you understand what you do not know?

Energy and motivation matter. PE is demanding. Firms want people who are genuinely excited about the work, not just attracted to the compensation or prestige.

## Preparing Effectively

Effective interview preparation is systematic, not haphazard.

Technical preparation should be complete before you need it. Practice modeling until you can build an LBO quickly and accurately. Review accounting concepts until they are automatic. Drill technical questions until answers are fluent.

Case study practice develops judgment. Work through cases with study partners, using materials from various sources. Practice structuring analysis, identifying key issues, and presenting recommendations.

Deal experience review ensures fluency. Know your transactions thoroughly. Anticipate questions about your role, key issues, and lessons learned. Practice articulating these clearly.

Narrative preparation polishes your story. Rehearse why PE, why now, why this firm until answers are natural and genuine. Practice behavioral examples until they flow smoothly.

Mock interviews simulate pressure. Practice with peers, mentors, or coaches to experience interview dynamics before the real thing. Solicit feedback and iterate.

Mental preparation addresses performance under pressure. The compressed timeline means interviews may occur with little notice when you are tired from banking work. Develop strategies for performing well regardless of circumstances.

## Key Takeaways

PE interviews typically involve first rounds with modeling tests and technical questions, followed by case studies and senior meetings. Technical assessment evaluates modeling skills, financial knowledge, and analytical capability. Case studies assess investment judgment—how you think about opportunities, not just whether you reach the right answer. Behavioral questions probe fit, motivation, and self-awareness. Effective preparation is systematic, covering technical skills, case practice, deal fluency, narrative polish, and mental readiness for high-pressure performance.
