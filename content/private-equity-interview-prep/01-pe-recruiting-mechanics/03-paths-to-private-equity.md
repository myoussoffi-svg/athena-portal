# Paths to Private Equity

While multiple routes lead to private equity, they are not equally traveled, nor equally valued by PE firms. Understanding the landscape of entry points—and where you fit within it—allows you to assess your positioning honestly and take strategic action to strengthen your candidacy.

## The Investment Banking Analyst Path

Investment banking remains the dominant pathway into PE, and for good reason. Banking analysts arrive with precisely calibrated skills: financial modeling proficiency, deal execution experience, transaction process knowledge, and the ability to work under intense pressure. PE firms hiring banking analysts know what they are getting—a pre-vetted candidate who has survived the filter of a demanding environment and emerged with directly applicable skills.

Within banking, certain paths carry more weight than others. Coverage groups at elite banks (Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Evercore, Centerview, Moelis, PJT, Lazard) produce disproportionate numbers of PE hires. Within these banks, M&A and leveraged finance groups are particularly valued because their work most closely mirrors PE activities. Industry coverage groups vary in their PE placement rates depending on sector demand—healthcare, technology, and industrials tend to be perennially active.

What seniors listen for when evaluating banking analysts is not just pedigree but deal quality. An analyst from a less-prestigious bank who has worked on multiple closed transactions with meaningful responsibility often outperforms a brand-name bank analyst who has spent two years on pitches that went nowhere. Deal experience matters enormously because it demonstrates that you have actually executed, not just theorized.

The timing consideration for banking analysts is critical. Most PE recruiting occurs when analysts have six to eighteen months of experience. This means you enter the recruiting process before you feel fully ready, which creates anxiety but also opportunity—firms expect to develop you, and your potential matters as much as your current capability.

## Consulting to Private Equity

Top-tier strategy consulting (McKinsey, Bain, BCG) provides an alternative path into PE, though it is narrower than the banking route. Consultants bring strategic thinking, structured problem-solving, and often deep industry expertise. However, they typically lack the financial modeling skills and transaction experience that banking analysts possess.

Consultants targeting PE often face a steeper learning curve on technical skills. They need to develop LBO modeling proficiency, understand credit agreements, and become comfortable with the mechanics of deal execution. Some successfully make this transition by targeting operationally-focused funds or growth equity firms where strategic insight is particularly valued. Others pursue additional training or even lateral moves into banking before making the PE jump.

If you are coming from consulting, be realistic about the additional preparation required. Your candidacy will be assessed against banking analysts who can build complex models in their sleep. You need compelling answers for why PE now and why you specifically will succeed despite the different background.

## Other Entry Points

Several less-common paths lead to PE, each with distinct characteristics.

Direct MBA hiring brings experienced professionals into PE at the associate level. This path is more common at mega-funds and often requires pre-MBA experience in banking, consulting, or relevant industry roles. Post-MBA associates enter with more maturity and leadership experience but face their own learning curve on the technical and execution dimensions.

Industry or corporate development professionals occasionally transition into PE, typically at sector-focused funds where their domain expertise adds significant value. A healthcare industry executive joining a healthcare-focused PE fund, or a technology operator joining a tech-focused growth equity firm, represents this pattern. These hires are less common and usually require existing relationships or specialized recruiting channels.

Operations backgrounds provide entry points to operationally-intensive PE firms, though rarely at the junior investment professional level. Operating partners and portfolio operations roles draw from executives with deep operational expertise, while investment professionals still predominantly come through banking and consulting.

Accounting and transaction advisory services occasionally lead to PE, particularly for individuals with strong transaction experience and CPA credentials. This path typically requires supplementing technical accounting knowledge with financial modeling skills and deal judgment.

## Timing Considerations

When you enter PE recruiting matters as much as how you enter. The traditional path involves starting as a first-year analyst and recruiting during your second year for a position that starts after banking. This timeline has compressed over the years, with recruiting now often beginning when analysts have barely a year of experience.

If you miss the traditional on-cycle window, off-cycle recruiting provides ongoing opportunities, particularly at middle market and smaller firms. Post-banking transitions (recruiting after completing the full analyst program) remain viable, though mega-fund opportunities become scarcer.

The timing calculation also involves your readiness. Recruiting before you have meaningful deal experience creates challenges—you have less material for interviews and less clarity about what you want. Recruiting too late means competing for fewer seats against candidates who acted earlier. Finding the right moment requires balancing these tensions.

## Assessing Your Own Position

Honest self-assessment is essential for effective recruiting. Consider your bank and group pedigree, your deal experience (both quality and quantity), your technical skills relative to expectations, your relationships and network within PE, and your timing within the recruiting cycle.

If your positioning has weaknesses, identify them now and address what you can. Weak technical skills can be improved through dedicated practice. Limited deal experience might be supplemented by seeking staffing on live transactions or volunteering for additional work. A network deficit can be remedied through systematic outreach.

What you cannot change—your bank, your group, your starting point—should not be sources of anxiety. Plenty of successful PE professionals come from non-traditional backgrounds. But realism about where you stand allows you to focus energy where it matters and craft your narrative effectively.

## Key Takeaways

Investment banking remains the primary feeder path to PE, with elite banks and M&A-focused groups providing the strongest positioning. Consulting offers an alternative route but requires additional technical preparation. Timing matters critically—most recruiting occurs when analysts have six to eighteen months of experience. Honest assessment of your own positioning allows you to identify and address weaknesses while crafting a compelling narrative for your target firms.
