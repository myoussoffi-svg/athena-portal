# Networking and Preparation Strategy

## Learning Objectives

- Develop a networking strategy that builds authentic relationships with PE professionals
- Understand how to allocate preparation time across technical skills, case studies, and fit
- Evaluate when and how to reach out to PE funds directly vs. relying on headhunters
- Identify the most effective preparation activities given the compressed recruiting timeline

## Written Guide

### Why Networking Matters in PE Recruiting

Unlike banking recruiting, where OCR (on-campus recruiting) dominates, PE recruiting is relationship-driven. Networking serves several purposes:

**Access**: Many smaller funds and off-cycle opportunities come through direct outreach, not headhunters.

**Referrals**: A warm introduction from a current PE professional can move you to the top of a headhunter's list or secure a direct interview.

**Information**: PE professionals can help you understand firm culture, deal focus, and what interviewers prioritize.

**Signaling**: Thoughtful, early networking demonstrates genuine interest and initiative.

However, networking is not a substitute for preparation. You must be technically ready to interview.

### Who to Network With

**Alumni**: Your school's alumni network is the easiest starting point. Alumni are often willing to help fellow graduates.

**Banking colleagues who moved to PE**: Former analysts or associates from your bank who transitioned to PE can provide recent, relevant insights.

**Friends of friends**: Leverage your personal network. If you know someone who knows a PE professional, ask for an introduction.

**Industry contacts**: If you've worked on deals involving sponsor-backed companies, you may have met PE professionals during transactions.

**Headhunters**: Networking with headhunters themselves is valuable. They can guide you on preparation and timing.

Avoid cold outreach to senior partners at mega-funds. Focus on associates, VPs, and principals who are closer to the recruiting process and more accessible.

### How to Network Effectively

**Start early**: Begin networking in the spring or summer of Year 1, well before recruiting begins. Rushed networking in the fall looks opportunistic.

**Be genuine**: Don't treat networking as a transaction. Show real interest in the person's career path, their firm, and their deals.

**Ask specific questions**: Instead of "Can you tell me about your firm?", ask "What's the most challenging part of sourcing deals in your sector?" or "How does your firm think about risk in growth equity investments?"

**Offer value**: If you worked on a deal in their portfolio or sector, mention it. Share perspectives from your banking experience.

**Follow up**: After a coffee or call, send a thank-you email. Stay in touch periodically (but don't overdo it—once a quarter is reasonable).

**Don't ask for a job directly**: Networking is about building relationships, not asking for favors. If they offer to make an introduction or refer you, great. If not, don't push.

### Networking Dos and Don'ts

**Do**:
- Reach out with a clear, concise email (3-4 sentences)
- Suggest a specific time or offer flexibility ("I'm happy to work around your schedule")
- Prepare thoughtful questions
- Be respectful of their time (20-30 minutes is appropriate)
- Send a thank-you note

**Don't**:
- Send generic, templated emails
- Ask for a job or referral in the first message
- Be pushy or entitled
- Reach out to dozens of people at the same firm
- Follow up excessively if they don't respond

### Direct Outreach to Funds

For smaller funds or off-cycle recruiting, direct outreach can be effective. Steps:

1. **Research the fund**: Understand their strategy, portfolio, recent deals, and team.
2. **Find the right contact**: Usually an associate, VP, or head of recruiting (if they have one).
3. **Send a concise email**: Express interest, highlight your relevant experience (deals, sectors, skills), and ask to connect.
4. **Attach your resume**: Make it easy for them to evaluate you.
5. **Be patient**: Smaller funds move slower than headhunter-driven processes.

Direct outreach works best for middle market and lower middle market funds. Mega-funds rarely respond to cold emails—headhunters are the gateway.

### Preparation Strategy: What to Focus On

Given the compressed timeline, you must prioritize. Here's a framework:

**Phase 1: Technical Foundations (Months 1-6 of Year 1)**:
- Master LBO modeling (Excel and paper LBOs)
- Refresh accounting and valuation concepts
- Understand DCF and comps deeply (you'll apply them in cases)
- Practice mental math and quick calculations

**Phase 2: Case Study Prep (Months 6-9)**:
- Learn case study frameworks (industry analysis, company assessment, investment thesis)
- Practice analyzing companies: review 10-Ks, build quick models, identify risks
- Run mock cases with peers or mentors

**Phase 3: Fit and Deal Prep (Months 6-9)**:
- Prepare to walk through deals you've worked on (know them cold)
- Develop your "Why PE?" and "Why this firm?" answers
- Follow recent transactions in your sectors of interest
- Prepare questions for interviewers

**Phase 4: Mock Interviews (Right Before Recruiting)**:
- Run full mock interviews (LBO test + case + fit)
- Get feedback from PE professionals or former candidates
- Refine your answers and practice under time pressure

### Time Allocation

If you have 10-15 hours per week to prepare:

- **40%** on LBO modeling and technical skills
- **30%** on case studies and company analysis
- **20%** on fit, deal walkthroughs, and market awareness
- **10%** on networking and relationship-building

Adjust based on your weaknesses. If you're strong technically but weak on cases, flip the allocation.

### Balancing Banking and Recruiting Prep

Recruiting happens while you're working as an analyst. Managing both is difficult:

**Set a schedule**: Block time on weekends or early mornings for prep. Treat it like a commitment.

**Use downtime strategically**: Slow periods at work (e.g., between deals) are opportunities to prepare.

**Communicate with your staffer**: Some banks are supportive of PE recruiting. Others are not. Be strategic about when you take time off for interviews.

**Prioritize interviews once they start**: If you get an interview at a top fund, that's more important than incremental facetime at the bank. Use vacation days if necessary.

### Common Mistakes

**Networking too late**: Waiting until fall of Year 1 to start networking is too late. Relationships take time to build.

**Over-preparing fit and under-preparing technical**: Many candidates can talk about "Why PE?" but fail the modeling test. Technical skills are non-negotiable.

**Ignoring case study prep**: Case studies differentiate strong candidates from average ones. Don't skip this.

**Not practicing under time pressure**: LBO tests and cases are timed. Practice without time limits doesn't prepare you for the real thing.

**Burning out before recruiting starts**: Preparing is a marathon, not a sprint. Pace yourself to avoid exhaustion when interviews begin.
