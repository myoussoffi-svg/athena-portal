# Off-Cycle Recruiting

While on-cycle recruiting captures most of the attention and anxiety in PE recruiting discussions, off-cycle opportunities represent a substantial portion of the market. Understanding what off-cycle recruiting involves, why firms recruit this way, and how to position yourself for these opportunities opens pathways that many candidates overlook.

## What Off-Cycle Means

Off-cycle recruiting refers to any PE hiring that occurs outside the traditional on-cycle window. This encompasses a wide range of situations: firms that never participate in on-cycle, positions that open unexpectedly, searches conducted with longer timelines, and secondary waves at firms that did not fill all seats during on-cycle.

The term "off-cycle" can be misleading because it implies something irregular or inferior. In reality, off-cycle recruiting is simply different. Many excellent PE opportunities—at well-regarded firms with strong track records—are filled through off-cycle processes. The difference lies in the dynamics: less time pressure, more deliberate evaluation, and different competitive conditions.

What seniors understand about off-cycle is that it offers a genuine alternative pathway. Candidates who missed on-cycle, who have non-traditional backgrounds, or who simply prefer a less pressured process can find excellent opportunities off-cycle. The key is understanding how the dynamics differ and adjusting your approach accordingly.

## Why Firms Recruit Off-Cycle

PE firms conduct off-cycle recruiting for various reasons, and understanding these motivations helps you identify and pursue opportunities effectively.

Firm size and structure influence recruiting approach. Many middle market and smaller funds lack the scale to justify formal on-cycle processes. They hire as needed, often one position at a time, with timelines that suit their operations rather than industry-wide cycles.

Unexpected departures create off-cycle needs. When an associate leaves unexpectedly—for another firm, business school, or a different opportunity—the fund must fill that seat. These positions may appear at any time.

Fund cycles affect timing. Firms raising new funds or experiencing portfolio growth may need to expand their teams outside normal recruiting windows. These capacity-driven hires can represent strong opportunities.

Strategic preferences lead some firms to explicitly avoid on-cycle. Partners at these firms believe the compressed timeline prevents proper evaluation of candidates. They prefer longer processes that allow deeper assessment of fit and capability.

Unfilled seats from on-cycle create secondary opportunities. Even elite funds sometimes fail to fill all positions during on-cycle—offers are declined, candidates renege, or fit issues emerge. These seats become off-cycle opportunities.

## Characteristics of Off-Cycle Processes

Off-cycle recruiting differs from on-cycle in several important ways.

Timeline is more relaxed. Off-cycle processes typically unfold over weeks or months rather than days. Initial conversations lead to follow-up discussions, then interviews, then offers—all with reasonable time between stages.

Evaluation is often more thorough. With less time pressure, firms can conduct more extensive diligence on candidates. Expect multiple rounds of interviews, detailed case studies, and potentially reference conversations.

Competition may be less intense. On-cycle concentrates all top candidates into a single window. Off-cycle spreads competition across time, potentially reducing the intensity at any given moment.

Certainty is different. Off-cycle opportunities may move forward or stall, and timelines are less predictable. A firm conducting an off-cycle search may pause if deal activity spikes or priorities shift.

Decision timelines are typically more reasonable. While exploding offers can still occur, off-cycle processes more often allow candidates time to evaluate opportunities thoughtfully.

## Who Should Consider Off-Cycle

Off-cycle recruiting suits certain candidate profiles and circumstances particularly well.

Those who missed on-cycle have an obvious reason to pursue off-cycle opportunities. Whether you started banking too late, were not prepared when on-cycle occurred, or simply did not receive offers, off-cycle provides another path.

Non-traditional candidates may find better reception off-cycle. Candidates from smaller banks, non-M&A groups, or alternative backgrounds can benefit from the longer evaluation periods that allow them to demonstrate capability beyond surface credentials.

Those seeking specific firm types may prefer off-cycle. If your target is a particular middle market firm that does not participate in on-cycle, pursuing them off-cycle is not a compromise—it is the appropriate strategy.

Candidates who prefer deliberate processes may choose off-cycle even if on-cycle is available. Some people perform better when not under extreme time pressure and prefer firms that value thoughtful evaluation.

Post-banking candidates often recruit off-cycle. If you are completing your banking program before transitioning to PE, you are likely beyond the normal on-cycle window and will pursue off-cycle opportunities by default.

## Positioning for Off-Cycle Success

Effective off-cycle recruiting requires different tactics than on-cycle.

Continuous readiness is essential. Unlike on-cycle, where timing is roughly predictable, off-cycle opportunities can appear at any time. Technical skills and narratives should be maintained at interview-ready levels.

Networking matters even more. Off-cycle opportunities are often not publicized. They emerge through relationships, referrals, and direct outreach. Building connections with PE professionals increases your visibility for opportunities that never reach headhunters.

Headhunters remain relevant but cover off-cycle differently. Some headhunters specialize in off-cycle searches. Maintaining headhunter relationships and expressing interest in off-cycle opportunities keeps you in relevant candidate pools.

Direct outreach can be effective. Unlike on-cycle, where nearly everything flows through headhunters, off-cycle processes are more open to direct candidate contact. Thoughtful outreach to firms you are targeting can surface opportunities.

Patience is required. Off-cycle recruiting is less predictable and may involve longer waits. Maintaining motivation and readiness over extended periods requires mental discipline.

## Off-Cycle Is Not Second-Tier

A persistent misconception holds that off-cycle opportunities are inferior—that the best firms fill all seats on-cycle and off-cycle represents leftovers. This view is incorrect.

Many excellent funds recruit exclusively off-cycle. Their decision to avoid the on-cycle frenzy reflects philosophical preferences, not inability to attract talent.

Off-cycle opportunities at top firms are genuine. When a mega-fund has an associate leave unexpectedly, the off-cycle replacement opportunity is at the same firm that filled positions on-cycle.

Middle market and growth equity include many attractive opportunities. The firms that recruit off-cycle include some of the most successful investors in their categories.

What seniors want you to understand is that off-cycle versus on-cycle is not a quality distinction—it is a process distinction. Strong candidates find excellent opportunities through both channels.

## Key Takeaways

Off-cycle recruiting encompasses PE hiring outside the traditional on-cycle window, including firms that never participate in on-cycle, unexpected vacancies, and unfilled seats from on-cycle. The process is typically less compressed, more deliberate, and involves different competitive dynamics. Off-cycle suits candidates who missed on-cycle, have non-traditional backgrounds, seek specific firm types, or prefer thoughtful evaluation. Success requires continuous readiness, strong networking, and patience. Off-cycle opportunities are not inferior—many excellent firms recruit exclusively through this channel.
