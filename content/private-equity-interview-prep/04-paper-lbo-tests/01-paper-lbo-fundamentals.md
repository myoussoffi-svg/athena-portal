The paper LBO is the signature PE interview exercise. When a partner hands you a single sheet with a company's financials and says "walk me through how you'd think about this investment," they're testing whether you can think like an investor without hiding behind a spreadsheet. This is where banking analysts either demonstrate they understand what drives returns or reveal they've been mechanically building models without grasping the underlying logic.

## What Interviewers Are Actually Testing

Let me be direct about what's happening when you're given a paper LBO. The interviewer already knows the answer. They built this case or have done it dozens of times. They're not looking for you to discover some hidden insight. They're evaluating three things: your structured thinking, your numerical fluency, and your ability to communicate under pressure.

Structured thinking means you approach the problem methodically. You don't jump straight to calculating IRR. You first understand the business, identify the key drivers, and then work through the math in a logical sequence. I've seen candidates start scribbling numbers immediately and lose track of what they're solving for. That's a red flag.

Numerical fluency means you can do reasonable mental math quickly. You don't need to be a human calculator, but you should be able to estimate that 1.5x your money in 5 years is roughly a 10% IRR without freezing. We'll cover the specific techniques in the next lesson, but know that this is trainable.

Communication under pressure means you're talking through your work, not sitting in silence. The interviewer wants to see your thought process. If you're stuck, say so and explain where you're stuck. That's infinitely better than staring at the page.

## Standard Paper LBO Assumptions

Paper LBOs are deliberately simplified. Understanding the standard assumptions helps you move quickly through the mechanics and focus on the analysis. Here's what you'll typically receive and what you should assume when information is missing.

For the acquisition, you'll usually get an EBITDA figure and an entry multiple. If not given explicitly, assume 8-10x EBITDA for a decent business, lower for distressed or cyclical companies, higher for growth or defensive names. You'll get a debt-to-EBITDA leverage level, typically 4-6x. Assume the rest is equity unless told otherwise.

For operating assumptions, expect a growth rate for revenue (often 3-5% for mature businesses) and a flat or slightly expanding margin. Paper LBOs rarely have complex margin dynamics. If you're not given capital expenditures, assume they equal depreciation (maintenance capex). This simplifies your free cash flow calculation significantly.

For the exit, assume the same multiple as entry unless told otherwise. Multiple expansion is a bonus; don't build your base case around it. The holding period is almost always 5 years. This isn't arbitrary; it matches the Rule of 72 nicely and represents a typical PE hold.

## The Standard Paper LBO Framework

Here's the framework I teach every analyst before their PE interviews. Memorize this sequence so you can execute it under pressure.

**Step 1: Sources and Uses.** Calculate the purchase price (EBITDA times entry multiple). Determine the debt amount (EBITDA times leverage). The difference is equity. If there are transaction fees, add them to uses and fund with additional equity.

For example, if a company has $100M EBITDA, you're paying 8x, and levering 5x, your purchase price is $800M, debt is $500M, and equity is $300M.

**Step 2: Year 5 EBITDA.** Apply the growth rate for 5 years. If EBITDA grows 5% annually, $100M becomes approximately $128M (or use the approximation that 5% for 5 years is about 28% total growth). If revenue grows but margins are flat, first grow revenue then apply the margin.

**Step 3: Debt Paydown.** Calculate annual free cash flow available for debt repayment. This is EBITDA minus interest, minus taxes on operating income, minus capex, minus any working capital changes. In a simplified paper LBO, assume FCF equals EBITDA minus interest minus taxes (at a given rate, usually 25-40%), minus maintenance capex.

Estimate cumulative debt paydown over 5 years. If FCF is $50M annually, you pay down $250M of debt.

**Step 4: Exit Enterprise Value.** Multiply Year 5 EBITDA by the exit multiple. Using our example, $128M times 8x equals approximately $1,024M.

**Step 5: Equity Value at Exit.** Subtract remaining debt from enterprise value. If you started with $500M debt and paid down $250M, you have $250M remaining. Exit equity is $1,024M minus $250M, or $774M.

**Step 6: Return Calculation.** Compare exit equity to entry equity. $774M divided by $300M equals 2.58x your money. For a 5-year hold, 2.5x is approximately 20% IRR (we'll cover why in the mental math lesson).

## What Makes a Good Paper LBO Answer

The mechanics above are necessary but not sufficient. What separates candidates who get offers from those who don't is the analysis that surrounds the math.

After completing your calculation, identify the key value drivers. In the example above, roughly half the return came from EBITDA growth ($28M increase times 8x equals $224M of value creation) and half from debt paydown ($250M of equity accretion). Multiple expansion would be pure upside.

Articulate what would need to be true for this to be a good investment. Does the 5% growth rate seem reasonable for this industry? Is 5x leverage appropriate given cash flow stability? What are the risks to the thesis?

Finally, identify sensitivities. If EBITDA grows only 3% instead of 5%, your exit EBITDA drops to about $116M, and your return falls significantly. Can you still hit your hurdle rate in that scenario?

This is what interviewers mean when they ask candidates to "think like an investor." The math is just the foundation. The insight is what closes the deal.
