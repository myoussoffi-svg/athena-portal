Take-home LBO tests evaluate a different skill set than paper LBOs. Where paper LBOs test mental math and structured thinking under pressure, take-home tests assess your modeling mechanics, attention to detail, and ability to deliver polished work product. Many candidates who ace paper LBOs stumble on take-homes because they underestimate the precision required.

## Types of Take-Home Tests

PE firms use several formats, each testing different competencies.

The **timed take-home** gives you a CIM or data set and 2-4 hours to build a model and write an investment memo. You complete this at home but submit by a deadline. These test efficiency, prioritization, and the ability to produce quality work quickly.

The **untimed take-home** provides materials and a deadline of 3-7 days. The expectation is near-perfect work. These test thoroughness, modeling sophistication, and professional polish.

The **in-office modeling test** brings you to the office for 3-4 hours with a computer and data. These combine paper LBO pressure with take-home rigor. Expect limited or no internet access.

The **case study presentation** extends the take-home by requiring a 15-30 minute presentation of your analysis. Beyond modeling, this tests communication and investment judgment.

Know what format you're facing so you can calibrate your preparation.

## Standard Take-Home Components

Most take-home LBO tests follow a predictable structure. Understanding what's expected helps you allocate time effectively.

You'll receive **source materials**: a confidential information memorandum (CIM), historical financials, and sometimes management projections. The CIM provides industry context, company description, and key operating metrics. Financials include 3-5 years of income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement.

You'll build an **operating model** projecting revenue, expenses, and working capital. Revenue may require segment-level builds or driver-based assumptions. Costs may separate fixed and variable components. Working capital usually derives from days metrics (DSO, DIO, DPO).

The **LBO model** layers on transaction structure (sources and uses), debt schedules, and returns analysis. You'll typically model 5-year projections with entry and exit assumptions.

Most tests require a **written deliverable**: an investment memo, decision recommendation, or summary of key findings. This demonstrates you can synthesize analysis into actionable conclusions.

Some tests include a **sensitivity analysis** showing how returns vary with key assumptions. At minimum, show sensitivities to entry/exit multiple and EBITDA growth.

## Setting Up Your Model Architecture

Before typing a single formula, spend 15-20 minutes planning your model structure. Candidates who dive straight into Excel often create tangled models that are hard to audit or modify.

Organize your model into clear sections:

**Assumptions tab**: All hard-coded inputs live here. Entry multiple, leverage levels, growth rates, margin assumptions, working capital days, tax rate, interest rate. This allows quick sensitivity analysis and makes your logic transparent.

**Operating model tab**: Revenue build, expense build, EBITDA calculation. Link everything to the assumptions tab. Format inputs differently from calculations (standard practice: blue for inputs, black for formulas).

**Financial statements tab**: Integrated income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement. The balance sheet must balance (assets equal liabilities plus equity). Cash flow must reconcile to change in cash on the balance sheet. These checks catch errors.

**Debt schedule tab**: Model each debt tranche separately. Calculate mandatory amortization, cash sweep (if applicable), interest expense, and ending balance. Link interest expense back to the income statement.

**Returns tab**: Sources and uses, entry equity, exit analysis, IRR and multiple calculations. Show sponsor returns and, if applicable, management returns separately.

**Sensitivities tab**: Two-way tables showing returns across different assumptions. At minimum, entry multiple versus exit multiple and EBITDA growth versus entry multiple.

## Common Data You'll Need to Calculate

Take-home tests rarely give you everything directly. You'll often need to derive key figures.

**EBITDA from financials**: Calculate as Revenue minus COGS minus SG&A, or Operating Income plus D&A. Reconcile to make sure your figure matches any EBITDA references in the CIM.

**Working capital**: Current assets (excluding cash) minus current liabilities (excluding debt). Calculate historical DSO, DIO, and DPO to project forward.

**Capex**: Look at the cash flow statement for capital expenditures. Distinguish maintenance capex (roughly equals D&A) from growth capex.

**Tax rate**: Calculate effective tax rate from historical financials (tax expense divided by pre-tax income). Use this for projections unless you have a reason to assume differently.

**Debt capacity**: Based on leverage assumptions, calculate maximum debt as EBITDA times target leverage. Confirm this doesn't exceed typical lender limits (often 6-7x for performing credits, lower for riskier situations).

## Quality Control Before Submission

Before submitting, systematically check your work.

**Formula audits**: Trace key formulas from inputs to outputs. Ensure everything links correctly. Check for hardcoded values hiding in formula cells.

**Balance sheet check**: Assets must equal liabilities plus equity. If it doesn't balance, you have an error. Common culprits: cash flow not flowing correctly, retained earnings not tying to net income, working capital not matching.

**Cash flow reconciliation**: Change in cash from the cash flow statement must equal ending cash minus beginning cash on the balance sheet.

**Sanity checks**: Does revenue growth match your assumptions? Do margins trend as expected? Is debt declining as cash flow is applied? Is IRR in a reasonable range for the entry multiple?

**Formatting**: Professional models use consistent formatting, clear labels, and logical flow. Sloppy formatting suggests sloppy thinking. Remove #REF errors, hide irrelevant rows, ensure numbers display properly.

**Written deliverable**: Proofread your memo. Check that numbers in the memo match the model. Confirm the recommendation is clear and supported by your analysis.

The take-home is your opportunity to demonstrate the work quality you'd deliver as an associate. Treat it as a real work product, not a school assignment.
