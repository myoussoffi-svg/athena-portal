Mental math separates confident paper LBO performances from anxious ones. When you can quickly estimate that 2.5x your money in 5 years is roughly 20% IRR, you spend your mental energy on analysis rather than arithmetic. The techniques in this lesson are not tricks; they're the same shortcuts that experienced PE professionals use daily. Master them before your interviews.

## The Rule of 72: Your Foundation

The Rule of 72 is the single most important mental math tool for PE interviews. It states that money doubles when the rate times time equals 72. At 12% IRR, money doubles in 6 years (12 times 6 equals 72). At 24% IRR, money doubles in 3 years.

For a 5-year hold, which is the PE standard, work backwards: 72 divided by 5 equals approximately 14.4%. This means doubling your money (2.0x) in 5 years is roughly 15% IRR. This single fact anchors all your return estimates.

From this foundation, build your mental reference table for 5-year holds:
- 1.5x money equals approximately 8-9% IRR
- 2.0x money equals approximately 15% IRR
- 2.5x money equals approximately 20% IRR
- 3.0x money equals approximately 25% IRR
- 4.0x money equals approximately 32% IRR

These approximations are accurate enough for paper LBOs. The exact figures differ by a percentage point or two, but interviewers aren't testing your precision. They're testing your ability to think.

## Deriving IRR from Multiples

When you calculate a money multiple that doesn't match your memorized values, use interpolation. If you get 2.25x in 5 years, it's halfway between 2.0x (15% IRR) and 2.5x (20% IRR), so estimate 17-18% IRR.

For more precision with unusual multiples, use this technique: think about what annual growth rate gets you there. A 2.0x requires 100% total return over 5 years, which is about 15% annual (since 1.15^5 is approximately 2.0). A 3.0x requires 200% total return, which breaks down to roughly 25% annual.

Here's the mental pattern: each additional 0.5x on your money multiple in a 5-year hold adds roughly 5 percentage points of IRR. Starting from the 2.0x equals 15% baseline:
- 2.5x is 15% plus 5% equals 20%
- 3.0x is 20% plus 5% equals 25%
- 3.5x is 25% plus 4-5% equals 29-30%

This pattern holds well through reasonable PE return ranges.

## Compounding Growth Quickly

Paper LBOs require you to grow EBITDA over 5 years. Rather than multiplying 1.05 five times in your head, use these approximations.

For 5 years of growth:
- 3% annual growth equals approximately 16% total (1.16x)
- 5% annual growth equals approximately 28% total (1.28x)
- 7% annual growth equals approximately 40% total (1.40x)
- 10% annual growth equals approximately 61% total (1.61x)

Memorize these. When told EBITDA grows 5% annually from $100M, immediately know you're at $128M in Year 5.

For quick estimation of other rates, use the rule that X% growth for 5 years is approximately (5 times X)% plus a small compounding bonus. 6% for 5 years is roughly 30% plus a couple points, so 33-34% total (actually 1.338x).

## Calculating Debt Paydown

Debt paydown calculations require estimating cumulative free cash flow. Here's how to do this efficiently.

First, estimate annual FCF. Take EBITDA, subtract interest, subtract taxes on operating income, subtract capex. For a simplified paper LBO with $100M EBITDA, $25M interest (5x leverage at 5% rate), 25% tax rate, and capex equal to D&A of $20M:

EBITDA: $100M
Less Interest: ($25M)
Pre-tax Income: $75M
Less Tax at 25%: ($19M)
After-tax Income: $56M
Add back D&A: $20M
Less Capex: ($20M)
FCF: $56M

If EBITDA grows but interest expense declines as you pay down debt, your FCF increases each year. For simplicity, take an average. If Year 1 FCF is $50M and Year 5 FCF is $70M, assume average FCF of $60M and total paydown of $300M over 5 years.

## Percentage Calculations

Several percentage shortcuts accelerate your paper LBO math.

To find 25% of a number, halve it twice. 25% of $800M: half is $400M, half again is $200M.

To find 30%, find 10% and multiply by 3. 30% of $150M: 10% is $15M, times 3 is $45M.

To find 5%, find 10% and halve. 5% of $500M debt: 10% is $50M, half is $25M interest.

To multiply by 8 (common for valuation multiples), double three times. $100M EBITDA times 8x: $100M to $200M to $400M to $800M.

To multiply by 1.5 (for 50% growth), add half the number to itself. $200M times 1.5: $200M plus $100M equals $300M.

## Putting It Together: A Rapid Estimation

Let's apply all these techniques to a complete paper LBO.

Given: $50M EBITDA, 8x entry, 5x leverage, 5% EBITDA growth, 5% interest rate, 25% tax rate, flat multiples, 5-year hold.

Sources and Uses (15 seconds):
- Purchase: $50M times 8 equals $400M
- Debt: $50M times 5 equals $250M
- Equity: $400M minus $250M equals $150M

Year 5 EBITDA (5 seconds):
- 5% growth for 5 years is 28%, so $50M times 1.28 equals $64M

Debt Paydown (30 seconds):
- Interest Year 1: 5% of $250M is $12.5M
- Approximate EBIT: $50M minus $10M D&A equals $40M
- Pre-tax income: $40M minus $12.5M equals $27.5M
- After-tax: 75% of $27.5M is about $21M
- Plus D&A minus Capex: net zero if maintenance
- FCF approximately $21M Year 1, growing to maybe $28M by Year 5
- Average $25M, total paydown $125M
- Remaining debt: $250M minus $125M equals $125M

Exit (10 seconds):
- Exit EV: $64M times 8 equals $512M
- Exit Equity: $512M minus $125M equals $387M

Returns (10 seconds):
- Multiple: $387M divided by $150M is about 2.6x
- IRR: 2.5x in 5 years is 20%, so this is slightly above 20%, call it 21%

Total time: about 70 seconds. With practice, you'll do this in under a minute while explaining your logic out loud. That's the goal.
