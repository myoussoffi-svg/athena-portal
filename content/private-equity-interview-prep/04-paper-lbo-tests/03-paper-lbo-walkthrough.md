Theory only takes you so far. This lesson walks through a complete paper LBO exactly as you would execute it in an interview. Follow along with pen and paper. Time yourself. The goal is to complete this in under 5 minutes while articulating your thought process clearly.

## The Setup

You're interviewing at a middle-market PE fund. The associate hands you this information:

"We're looking at a specialty packaging company. $80M revenue, 25% EBITDA margins. Growing 4% annually. We'd pay 7x EBITDA and lever it 4.5x. D&A is $5M annually. Assume 6% interest rate, 30% tax rate, capex equals D&A, and no working capital changes. Five-year hold, exit at the same multiple. What returns are we looking at?"

Take 30 seconds to organize the information before calculating.

## Step 1: Establish the Baseline

Start by confirming what you know and stating any assumptions.

"So we have $80M revenue at 25% margins, giving us $20M EBITDA. Entry at 7x means a $140M purchase price. At 4.5x leverage, that's $90M of debt and $50M of equity."

Write these anchor numbers clearly:
- EBITDA: $20M
- Entry EV: $140M
- Debt: $90M
- Equity: $50M

Already you've demonstrated you can quickly translate the setup into an LBO structure.

## Step 2: Project EBITDA Growth

"Revenue grows 4% annually with flat margins. Over 5 years, 4% compounds to approximately 22% total growth."

The precise math: 1.04^5 equals 1.217, so 21.7%. Rounding to 22% is fine.

"That takes revenue from $80M to about $98M, and at 25% margins, Year 5 EBITDA is approximately $24.5M. Let me round to $24M to keep the math clean."

Alternatively, just grow EBITDA directly: $20M times 1.22 equals $24.4M.

Write: Year 5 EBITDA: $24M

## Step 3: Calculate Free Cash Flow and Debt Paydown

This is where candidates often stumble. Be methodical.

"Let me work through the cash flow. Starting EBITDA is $20M. D&A is $5M, so EBIT is $15M. Interest on $90M at 6% is $5.4M, call it $5M for simplicity. Pre-tax income is $10M. At 30% taxes, that's $3M of tax, leaving $7M net income. Add back D&A of $5M, subtract capex of $5M, and I get $7M of free cash flow in Year 1."

Walk through the progression: "As EBITDA grows and I pay down debt, FCF increases. By Year 5, EBITDA is $24M, so EBIT is $19M. If I've paid down, say, $30M of debt, I have $60M remaining at 6%, which is $3.6M interest. Pre-tax income is $15.4M, taxes are $4.6M, net income is $10.8M. FCF is around $11M."

"Year 1 FCF is $7M, Year 5 is roughly $11M. Average is about $9M. Over 5 years, that's $45M of debt paydown."

Write:
- Cumulative Debt Paydown: $45M
- Remaining Debt at Exit: $90M minus $45M equals $45M

Note: You could also calculate each year precisely, but in an interview, this averaged approach is acceptable and faster. State your methodology so the interviewer knows you understand the dynamics.

## Step 4: Calculate Exit Value

"At exit, Year 5 EBITDA is $24M. Exiting at the same 7x multiple gives an enterprise value of $168M."

This is straightforward: $24M times 7 equals $168M.

Write: Exit EV: $168M

## Step 5: Determine Exit Equity and Returns

"Enterprise value of $168M minus remaining debt of $45M equals exit equity of $123M."

"I invested $50M of equity and received $123M back. That's a 2.46x multiple of invested capital. Call it 2.5x."

"For a 5-year hold, 2.5x is approximately 20% IRR."

Write:
- Exit Equity: $123M
- MOIC: 2.5x
- IRR: ~20%

## Step 6: Provide the Investment Analysis

The math is complete, but don't stop there. Add brief commentary.

"So we're looking at roughly a 2.5x and 20% IRR, which hits typical PE hurdle rates. The return is driven by two factors: EBITDA growth contributing about $28M of value creation (the $4M EBITDA increase times 7x multiple) and debt paydown contributing $45M to equity."

"The thesis depends on the 4% growth being achievable. For a specialty packaging company, I'd want to understand the customer concentration and whether growth is coming from volume or price. The leverage at 4.5x is moderate, so the downside is somewhat protected."

"Key risks would be margin compression if input costs rise, or customer losses. I'd also want to confirm the capex assumption; if this business requires investment to grow, returns would be lower."

## The Complete Response: Timed

Here's what the full answer looks like, condensed. Practice delivering this in 4-5 minutes.

"Let me start with the entry. $80M revenue at 25% margins is $20M EBITDA. At 7x, that's a $140M purchase price. Levering 4.5x means $90M debt, $50M equity.

For growth, 4% annually for 5 years compounds to about 22%, taking EBITDA from $20M to $24M.

On cash flow: Year 1 EBIT is $15M, interest is about $5M on the $90M at 6%, pre-tax income is $10M, taxes at 30% are $3M, giving $7M net income. With D&A and capex offsetting, FCF is $7M. This grows to about $11M by Year 5 as EBITDA increases and debt declines. Averaging around $9M annually, I estimate $45M total debt paydown, leaving $45M of debt at exit.

Exit EV is $24M EBITDA times 7x, or $168M. Subtract $45M debt to get $123M exit equity. That's a 2.5x on my $50M investment, roughly 20% IRR over 5 years.

Returns are split between operational value creation from EBITDA growth and financial engineering from debt paydown. The deal works if the growth assumption holds, which I'd want to diligence around customer dynamics and competitive positioning."

## Practice Variations

Once you can execute this case smoothly, practice these modifications:
- What if entry were 8x instead of 7x?
- What if growth were only 2%?
- What if we could achieve 100bps of margin expansion?
- What if interest rates were 8%?

Each variation tests whether you truly understand the drivers or were just following a memorized script.
