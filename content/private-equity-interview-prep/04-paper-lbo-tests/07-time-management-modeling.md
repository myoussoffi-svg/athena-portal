Time pressure turns competent modelers into frantic ones. I've seen candidates with strong technical skills fail modeling tests because they ran out of time with an incomplete model and no memo. The solution isn't to work faster; it's to work smarter. This lesson provides the time management framework that separates candidates who finish from those who don't.

## The Time Allocation Framework

For a 3-hour modeling test, allocate your time as follows:

**Planning (15 minutes):** Read all materials. Identify key inputs. Sketch your model structure on paper. This investment pays dividends throughout the test.

**Operating Model (45 minutes):** Revenue build, expense projections, EBITDA calculation, working capital. Get the core drivers working before moving on.

**Transaction Structure (30 minutes):** Sources and uses, debt schedules, interest calculations. These are mechanical once you have EBITDA.

**Financial Statements (30 minutes):** Income statement, balance sheet, cash flow statement. Focus on cash flow first since it drives debt paydown.

**Returns Analysis (20 minutes):** Exit calculation, IRR, sensitivities. These are the outputs interviewers care most about.

**Memo and Polish (30 minutes):** Write your investment recommendation. Format the model. Quality check the numbers.

**Buffer (10 minutes):** Things take longer than expected. Build in cushion.

For 4-hour tests, extend the operating model and memo time. For 2-hour tests, compress operating model to 30 minutes and accept less detailed projections.

## The MVP Approach

Here's the most important principle: complete a working minimum viable product (MVP) before adding complexity. A simple model that generates a return is infinitely better than a sophisticated model that's 80% complete.

What constitutes an MVP?
- Sources and uses that balance
- EBITDA projection (can be simple growth rate, no segment build required)
- Debt schedule with interest calculation
- Cash flow sufficient to determine debt paydown
- Exit value and return calculation

With these elements, you can answer the fundamental question: what returns does this generate? Everything else is refinement.

If you're running behind schedule at the 90-minute mark of a 3-hour test and don't have a working return calculation, stop whatever detailed work you're doing and build the MVP. You can return to add complexity with remaining time.

## Prioritization Under Pressure

When time is short, prioritize ruthlessly.

**High priority (must have):**
- Entry EBITDA and transaction structure
- Basic EBITDA projection
- Debt service and paydown
- Returns calculation

**Medium priority (should have):**
- Detailed revenue build by segment
- Working capital dynamics
- Sensitivity tables
- Formatted financial statements

**Lower priority (nice to have):**
- Elaborate scenario analysis
- Perfect balance sheet balancing
- Detailed footnotes and documentation

If your balance sheet doesn't balance and you have 15 minutes left, don't spend all 15 minutes debugging. Plug the variance with a note ("balance sheet plug to be reconciled"), calculate your returns, and write your memo. Interviewers prefer a thoughtful recommendation with a minor model error over a perfect model with no conclusion.

## Building Speed Through Templates

Before your interview, prepare a template with standard model structure. When the clock starts, you import the template and begin populating, rather than building from scratch.

Your template should include:
- Assumptions section with typical PE deal inputs
- Sources and uses format
- Basic financial statement structure
- Debt schedule format for multiple tranches
- IRR calculation formula (using XIRR for flexibility)
- Sensitivity table structure

Customize during the test; don't create during the test.

Some firms prohibit external templates. In that case, memorize the structure and rebuild it quickly from memory. The first 10 minutes building scaffolding saves 30 minutes of reorganizing later.

## Keyboard Shortcuts That Save Minutes

Each shortcut saves seconds, but seconds compound into minutes over a 3-hour test.

**Navigation:**
- Ctrl+Home: Go to cell A1
- Ctrl+End: Go to last used cell
- Ctrl+Arrow: Jump to edge of data region
- Ctrl+Page Up/Down: Move between worksheets

**Editing:**
- F2: Edit cell
- Ctrl+C/V/X: Copy, paste, cut
- Ctrl+D: Fill down
- Ctrl+R: Fill right
- Ctrl+;: Insert current date
- F4: Toggle absolute/relative reference

**Formatting:**
- Ctrl+1: Format cells dialog
- Ctrl+B/I/U: Bold, italic, underline
- Ctrl+Shift+$: Currency format
- Ctrl+Shift+%: Percentage format

**Formulas:**
- Alt+=: AutoSum
- Ctrl+`: Show formulas
- Ctrl+[: Trace precedents (go to source cells)
- F9 (in formula bar): Evaluate selection

Learn these until they're automatic. Reaching for the mouse costs time.

## Common Time Traps to Avoid

Certain activities consume disproportionate time. Recognize and limit them.

**Trap 1: Perfecting the revenue build.** Detailed segment-level projections are impressive but time-consuming. If segments have similar growth profiles, simplify to a consolidated projection. Add segment detail only if it materially affects the analysis.

**Trap 2: Chasing balance sheet errors.** Balance sheet reconciliation can consume hours if you have a structural error. Build in a "plug" line that forces balance while you continue. Come back to debug if time permits.

**Trap 3: Over-formatting early.** Format once at the end, not continuously as you build. Stopping to adjust column widths or colors interrupts analytical flow.

**Trap 4: Building unnecessary complexity.** If the test doesn't ask for a DCF, don't build one to show off. If a simple growth rate works, don't build a bottoms-up model. Match complexity to requirements.

**Trap 5: Not reading instructions carefully.** Some tests specify exactly what deliverables are required. Missing a required element because you didn't read carefully is an avoidable failure. Spend time upfront understanding expectations.

## The Final 30 Minutes

The last 30 minutes determine your grade. Use them deliberately.

**Minutes 1-5:** Stop building. Review what you have. Identify critical gaps.

**Minutes 5-15:** Fill gaps in priority order. Calculate any missing returns. Build key sensitivities.

**Minutes 15-25:** Write your memo. State your recommendation, key return metrics, and primary risks. Clear conclusions matter more than length.

**Minutes 25-30:** Quality check. Do outputs make sense? Any obvious errors? Save your file. Confirm delivery method.

Submit on time. Late submissions are typically rejected regardless of quality. A good-but-not-perfect model submitted on time beats a perfect model submitted late.
