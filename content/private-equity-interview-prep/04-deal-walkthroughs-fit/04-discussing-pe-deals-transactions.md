## Written Guide

### Why Interviewers Ask About PE Deals

"Tell me about a recent PE deal" or "What do you think about [transaction]?" tests:

**Market awareness**: Are you following the PE market?

**Judgment**: Can you evaluate whether a deal makes sense?

**Technical knowledge**: Do you understand deal structures, valuation, and returns?

**Communication**: Can you discuss deals clearly and concisely?

### How to Prepare

Follow 5-10 recent PE transactions in sectors or markets you're interested in. For each, know:

**Basic facts**: Sponsor, target company, deal size, valuation multiple (if disclosed), deal structure

**Why the deal makes sense**: Strategic rationale, industry tailwinds, value creation opportunities

**What's interesting or notable**: High valuation, competitive auction, add-on acquisition, growth equity vs. buyout

**Potential risks**: Industry headwinds, high leverage, competitive threats

**Outcome (if known)**: Did the deal close? How has the portfolio company performed?

### What to Look For in PE Deals

When evaluating a PE transaction, consider:

**Valuation**: Is the entry multiple high, low, or in line with market? High multiples (12×+ EBITDA) are harder to generate returns from unless there's significant EBITDA growth.

**Leverage**: What's the Debt/EBITDA multiple? High leverage (6×+) increases risk but amplifies returns.

**Investment thesis**: What's the value creation story? Operational improvements, add-ons, growth, margin expansion?

**Industry dynamics**: Is the industry attractive (growing, fragmented, high barriers) or challenged (declining, competitive)?

**Sponsor's track record**: Does the sponsor have experience in this sector or with similar deals?

**Exit path**: How will the sponsor exit? Strategic sale, secondary buyout, IPO?

### Example: Discussing a Recent PE Deal

**Interviewer**: "Tell me about a PE deal you've been following."

**Candidate**:

"I've been following [Sponsor]'s acquisition of [Company] for [$X], which closed earlier this year. It's a [sector] company with about [$Y] in EBITDA, and the deal was done at approximately [Z]× EBITDA, which is slightly above recent market multiples for the sector.

What I find interesting about this deal is the buy-and-build strategy. The company is a platform in a fragmented market with strong unit economics, and the sponsor has a track record of consolidating similar industries through add-on acquisitions. The investment thesis seems to rest on achieving cost synergies and expanding margins as the platform scales.

The biggest risk I see is the high entry multiple—at [Z]×, the sponsor will need to execute well on add-ons and operational improvements to generate attractive returns. If the market cools or if integration challenges arise, returns could be compressed. That said, the sponsor has done several successful buy-and-builds in adjacent sectors, so I think they have the playbook to make it work."

This answer demonstrates research, technical understanding, and balanced judgment.

### Discussing Portfolio Companies

If interviewing at a specific firm, be prepared to discuss their portfolio companies:

**Research 2-3 portfolio companies**: What do they do? When were they acquired? What value creation initiatives are underway?

**Ask intelligent questions**: "I saw that you invested in [Company]. Can you talk about the investment thesis and how the company has performed?"

**Show genuine interest**: "I'm particularly interested in [Company] because of its position in [market]. What challenges has the team faced in scaling the business?"

### Common Mistakes

**Not following any deals**: Saying "I haven't been following PE deals" signals lack of interest.

**Discussing deals superficially**: "I saw that KKR bought a company" without details or analysis.

**Being overly critical**: Saying "That deal was terrible" is risky—the interviewer may have worked on it or know the sponsor.

**Not being able to defend your view**: If you say a deal makes sense, be ready to explain why. If you say it's risky, explain the risks.

**Discussing deals from years ago**: Focus on recent transactions (last 6-12 months).
