## Written Guide

### Why Deal Walkthroughs Matter

"Walk me through a deal you worked on" is universal in PE interviews. It tests:

**Technical knowledge**: Do you understand deal mechanics, valuation, and financing?

**Depth of involvement**: Were you a passive observer or active contributor?

**Communication**: Can you explain complex transactions clearly?

**Judgment**: Can you discuss what went well, what was challenging, and what you learned?

### How to Prepare

For each deal you worked on, know:

**Basic facts**: Client name, transaction type (M&A, financing, restructuring), deal size, your role, outcome

**Deal rationale**: Why did the client pursue this transaction? Strategic rationale, financial objectives

**Valuation**: What valuation methodologies were used? What multiples or metrics? How was pricing determined?

**Financing**: How was the deal financed? Debt, equity, or mix? What were the debt terms?

**Your role**: What did you specifically do? Building models, preparing materials, conducting analysis, attending meetings

**Challenges and outcome**: What were the key challenges? Did the deal close? What did you learn?

Pick 2-3 deals you know cold. Prepare to go deep.

### The Deal Walkthrough Framework

Use this structure:

**1. Overview (30 seconds)**:
"I worked on [Client]'s acquisition of [Target] for [$X]. It was a strategic acquisition to expand into [geography/product line/capability]. My role was to support the valuation analysis and financing structure."

**2. Rationale (20 seconds)**:
"The client pursued this acquisition to gain market share in [segment], achieve cost synergies of [$Y], and expand geographically."

**3. Valuation (30 seconds)**:
"We valued the target using DCF, comps, and precedent transactions. DCF suggested a range of [$A-$B], comps were trading at [X-Y]× EBITDA, and recent M&A transactions were at [Z]× EBITDA. We recommended a purchase price of [$C], which was [multiple] on LTM EBITDA."

**4. Financing (20 seconds)**:
"The deal was financed with [%] debt and [%] equity. The debt package included [$] of term loans and [$] of senior notes. We modeled the pro forma leverage at [X]× Debt/EBITDA."

**5. Your Role (20 seconds)**:
"I built the DCF and LBO models, ran sensitivity analyses, and prepared presentation materials for the client and lenders. I also attended management meetings to discuss financial projections."

**6. Outcome (10 seconds)**:
"The deal closed in [month]. It was a valuable learning experience in [specific skill, e.g., valuation under uncertainty, structuring complex debt packages]."

Total: ~2 minutes. Concise, structured, informative.

### Anticipating Follow-Up Questions

Interviewers will drill down:

**"What were the key risks in this deal?"**

Be ready to discuss operational, market, financial, or integration risks.

**"Why did the buyer pay [X]× EBITDA?"**

Explain valuation drivers: growth, margins, market position, synergies.

**"What challenges did you encounter?"**

Discuss valuation disagreements, financing complexities, tight timelines, or due diligence findings.

**"If you were the buyer's PE investor, would you have done this deal?"**

This tests PE judgment. Consider: Was the price reasonable? Were synergies achievable? Was leverage appropriate?

**"Walk me through your DCF model."**

Be ready to explain key assumptions: revenue growth, margins, CapEx, WACC, terminal value.

### Common Mistakes

**Being vague**: "I worked on an M&A deal for a client" without specifics

**Exaggerating your role**: Claiming you "led the valuation" when you were an analyst supporting the team

**Not knowing details**: Forgetting the deal size, valuation multiples, or financing structure

**Rambling**: Taking 5 minutes to explain when 2 minutes suffices

**Not preparing for follow-ups**: Knowing the overview but unable to explain valuation methodology or key assumptions
