- Handle questions about long-term plans without overcommitting or appearing unfocused
- Demonstrate that you're committed to PE while being realistic about career paths

## Written Guide

### Why Interviewers Ask About Career Goals

"Where do you see yourself in 5 years?" or "What do you want to learn in PE?" tests:

**Commitment**: Are you serious about PE, or just exploring?

**Self-awareness**: Have you thought about what you want to develop?

**Realism**: Do you understand what's achievable in PE?

**Fit**: Are your goals aligned with what the firm offers?

### What to Say About Short-Term Goals (2-3 Years)

Focus on **skill development** and **learning**:

**Technical skills**: "I want to deepen my LBO modeling and valuation skills, particularly in building complex debt structures and evaluating add-on acquisition opportunities."

**Investment judgment**: "I want to develop the ability to identify attractive investments quickly, assess risks, and construct defensible investment theses."

**Sector expertise**: "I'm interested in building expertise in [sector], understanding the competitive dynamics and key value drivers."

**Portfolio management**: "I want to learn how to work with management teams to implement value creation initiatives and track portfolio company performance."

Avoid: "I want to be promoted to VP" (too focused on titles) or "I want to learn everything" (too vague).

### What to Say About Long-Term Goals (5+ Years)

Be honest but not overly specific. Acknowledge that PE offers multiple paths:

**Staying in PE**: "Long-term, I see myself continuing in private equity, potentially moving up to a senior investment role where I'm leading deals and mentoring junior team members. I find the work intellectually engaging, and I want to build a career in investing."

**Optionality**: "I'm focused on building a strong foundation in PE for the next several years. Beyond that, I'm open to various paths—staying in PE, joining a portfolio company in an operating role, or potentially starting a business. But my immediate focus is on becoming an excellent investor."

**Business school**: "After 2-3 years in PE, I may pursue business school to broaden my network and skill set, with the goal of returning to PE at a senior level."

### What to Say You Want to Learn

Frame learning goals around:

**Deal execution**: "I want to learn how to lead diligence workstreams, manage deal processes, and present investment recommendations to investment committees."

**Value creation**: "I'm excited to learn how PE firms work with management teams to improve operations, drive growth, and implement strategic initiatives."

**Sector knowledge**: "I want to build deep expertise in [sector]—understanding key trends, competitive dynamics, and what makes companies successful."

**Investment decision-making**: "I want to develop the judgment to identify which deals to pursue and which to pass on, and to understand what drives successful investments."

### Handling "Why Not Stay in Banking Longer?"

Some interviewers ask why you're leaving banking after only 1-2 years.

**Strong answer**:

"Banking has been an excellent training ground, and I've learned a lot about financial analysis, deal mechanics, and working under pressure. However, I'm ready to move from advisory to principal investing. I want to be the one making investment decisions, not just providing recommendations. PE offers the opportunity to go deeper on fewer deals, develop investment judgment, and see the long-term impact of value creation, which is what I'm looking for at this stage of my career."

### Handling "What If You Don't Get PE?"

Be honest but show commitment:

"I'm committed to pursuing PE, and I'm confident in my preparation. If I don't land a role in this recruiting cycle, I'll continue in banking, keep building my skills, and recruit again in the off-cycle or next year. I'd also consider other paths to PE, like joining a portfolio company and transitioning later. But my goal is to move into PE, and I'm focused on making that happen."

### Common Mistakes

**Being too focused on exits**: "I want to do PE for 2 years and then go to business school" signals you're not committed.

**Being unrealistic**: "I want to be a partner in 5 years" is not credible.

**Being vague**: "I want to learn and grow" without specifics.

**Saying you're unsure about PE**: "I'm exploring PE and hedge funds" makes you seem uncommitted.
