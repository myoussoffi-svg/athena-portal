## Written Guide

### The Role of Debt in LBOs

Leverage is the defining characteristic of a leveraged buyout. The ability to acquire a company using substantial debt amplifies equity returns when the investment performs well. But leverage is not free—it brings interest costs, covenant restrictions, and refinancing risk. Understanding how to structure debt is essential to LBO analysis and a core competency tested in interviews.

The debt portion of Sources typically comprises 50-70% of the total acquisition financing. The precise amount depends on the target company's cash flow stability, the lending environment, and the sponsor's risk tolerance. In a favorable credit market, a sponsor might push leverage to 6-7x EBITDA. In tighter conditions, 4-5x might be the maximum available.

### Senior Secured Debt

Senior secured debt sits at the top of the capital structure with first priority claim on the company's assets. This security position means lower risk for lenders, which translates to lower interest rates for borrowers. Senior secured debt is typically the largest component of LBO financing.

**Term Loan A (TLA)**: Amortizing term loans with mandatory principal payments, typically 5-10% annually. TLAs are usually provided by banks and carry floating interest rates at a spread over SOFR (formerly LIBOR). Spreads might range from 200-400 basis points depending on credit quality. TLAs have shorter maturities, often 5-7 years.

**Term Loan B (TLB)**: Institutional term loans with minimal amortization (typically 1% annually) and bullet repayment at maturity. TLBs are syndicated to institutional investors like CLOs and credit funds. They carry higher spreads than TLAs (often 400-600 bps) but provide more flexibility with less mandatory principal payment. Maturities are typically 7 years.

**Revolving Credit Facility (Revolver)**: A committed but undrawn line of credit providing liquidity for working capital needs and general corporate purposes. The revolver is typically undrawn at close, so it appears in Sources at $0 but provides ongoing access to capital. Companies pay a commitment fee (typically 25-50 bps) on undrawn amounts.

In Sources and Uses, drawn term loans appear at face value. If you raise $500 million of Term Loan B, $500 million appears in Sources. The revolver capacity (say, $100 million) is noted but not included in Sources if undrawn.

### Subordinated Debt and Mezzanine

Below senior secured debt sit various subordinated instruments. These provide additional leverage beyond what senior lenders will extend, but at higher cost.

**Second Lien Debt**: Secured debt with a second priority claim on assets behind the first lien. Second lien lenders can seize collateral only after first lien claims are satisfied. This subordination means higher spreads—typically 600-900 bps over SOFR. Second lien loans are often provided by credit funds and distressed investors.

**Senior Subordinated Notes**: Unsecured debt that ranks below all secured debt but above junior subordinated and equity. These are often privately placed with institutional investors. Pricing reflects the higher risk—yields of 10-14% are common.

**Mezzanine Financing**: Hybrid instruments combining debt and equity features. Mezzanine debt typically carries cash interest plus a PIK (payment-in-kind) component and may include warrants or conversion features. All-in yields of 15-20% reflect the position near the bottom of the debt stack.

The choice between these instruments involves trade-offs. Second lien debt is less expensive than mezzanine but requires collateral. Mezzanine is more expensive but more flexible and may not appear in covenant calculations. Each incremental turn of leverage below senior debt carries incrementally higher costs.

### High-Yield Bonds

For larger LBOs, high-yield bonds provide an alternative to bank loans. Bonds are publicly traded securities with fixed interest rates and bullet maturities, typically 7-10 years. They offer several advantages:

**No Amortization**: Unlike term loans, bonds do not require principal payments until maturity. This preserves cash flow for other purposes.

**Fixed Rates**: Bond coupons are typically fixed, providing certainty on interest costs (though this can be a disadvantage if rates decline).

**Fewer Covenants**: Bond covenants are typically "incurrence-based," meaning they only apply when the company takes specific actions (like incurring additional debt). This provides more operational flexibility than "maintenance covenants" that must be satisfied quarterly.

High-yield bonds are priced at spreads over comparable Treasury yields. A BB-rated bond might yield Treasury plus 400 bps, while a B-rated bond might yield Treasury plus 600 bps.

### Calculating Debt Capacity

Lenders underwrite debt capacity based on several metrics:

**Total Debt / EBITDA**: The primary leverage metric. Senior secured lenders might extend 4-5x EBITDA. Total leverage (including subordinated debt) might reach 6-7x in favorable markets.

**Senior Debt / EBITDA**: Many deals distinguish between senior and total leverage. Senior debt limits are typically 4-5x, with additional subordinated debt bringing total leverage higher.

**EBITDA / Cash Interest (Interest Coverage)**: Measures ability to service debt from operating cash flow. Lenders typically require 2.0x or higher coverage.

**Free Cash Flow / Debt Service**: Measures ability to cover both interest and principal payments. Required coverage varies by deal structure.

Consider a target company with $100 million EBITDA. If lenders will extend 5x senior leverage and the market supports 6.5x total leverage:

- Maximum senior debt: $500 million
- Maximum subordinated debt: $150 million (6.5x - 5.0x = 1.5x)
- Total debt capacity: $650 million

This debt capacity directly constrains the Sources and Uses. If Uses total $1 billion, and debt capacity is $650 million, the sponsor must contribute $350 million of equity.

### Debt Pricing and Fees

Beyond interest rates, debt financing involves various fees that appear in Uses:

**Arrangement Fee**: Paid to lead arrangers for structuring and syndicating the debt. Typically 1-2% of committed amount.

**Commitment Fee**: Paid on undrawn revolver capacity. Typically 25-50 bps annually.

**Upfront Fee / OID**: Institutional lenders often receive an upfront fee, expressed as Original Issue Discount. A term loan with 2% OID is funded at 98 cents on the dollar—the lender receives $98 million in proceeds but the obligation is $100 million.

**Ticking Fee**: If there is a delay between commitment and funding, lenders may charge a ticking fee on the committed amount.

These fees are real costs that affect returns. In Sources and Uses, arrangement fees appear in Uses as a transaction cost. OID effectively increases the interest cost of the debt and is amortized over the loan life.

### Covenant Structures

Debt covenants constrain borrower behavior to protect lender interests. Understanding covenant structures is essential for deal structuring.

**Maintenance Covenants**: Must be satisfied at each testing period (typically quarterly). Common maintenance covenants include:
- Maximum Total Debt / EBITDA
- Maximum Senior Debt / EBITDA
- Minimum Interest Coverage
- Minimum Fixed Charge Coverage

If the borrower breaches a maintenance covenant, it triggers a default regardless of whether payments are current.

**Incurrence Covenants**: Only tested when the borrower takes specific actions. For example, an incurrence test might prevent additional debt issuance unless pro forma leverage is below 5.0x. High-yield bonds typically use incurrence covenants.

**Covenant-Lite (Cov-Lite)**: Many institutional term loans have shifted to incurrence-only covenants, similar to bonds. This provides borrowers with significant flexibility but reduces lender protections.

The interplay between covenant structures and operating projections is critical. The LBO model must demonstrate that the company maintains covenant compliance throughout the projection period. If projections show a covenant breach, the deal structure must change—either less debt, more flexible covenants, or improved operations.

### Interview Application

When discussing debt in interviews, demonstrate understanding of the capital structure hierarchy, the trade-offs between instruments, and how debt capacity constrains transaction sizing. Key questions to prepare for:

"How would you structure the debt for this deal?"
"What happens if EBITDA falls by 20%—can the company service its debt?"
"Why use second lien instead of mezzanine?"
"How does covenant-lite affect the risk profile?"

Strong candidates can discuss these topics with the fluency of someone who has actually worked on financing negotiations.
