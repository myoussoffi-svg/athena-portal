- Explain the conceptual framework connecting transaction value to financing structure
- Identify the critical linkages between Sources and Uses and the rest of the LBO model
- Articulate how Sources and Uses impacts returns analysis

## Written Guide

### Why Sources and Uses Matters

Every leveraged buyout begins with a single question: how much money do we need, and where is it coming from? The Sources and Uses framework answers this question with precision. It is not merely an accounting exercise—it is the architectural foundation upon which the entire LBO model is constructed.

When you sit down to build an LBO model, Sources and Uses is where you start. Before you can project cash flows, before you can calculate returns, before you can assess debt paydown schedules, you must first establish the opening position. How much equity is the sponsor contributing? What debt instruments are being employed? What exactly are we paying for? These questions define the transaction economics that flow through every subsequent calculation.

The reason interviewers focus heavily on Sources and Uses is because it tests whether you truly understand how an LBO works mechanically. Anyone can memorize the IRR formula. But explaining why the sponsor check size changes when you add a revolver, or how transaction fees affect goodwill, demonstrates genuine comprehension of the moving parts.

### The Fundamental Equation

At its core, Sources and Uses embodies a simple accounting identity: Total Sources must equal Total Uses. This is not optional—it is mathematically required. Every dollar spent in the transaction must come from somewhere.

**Sources = Uses**

This equation forces discipline. If you calculate that acquiring a company requires $500 million, you must identify exactly $500 million in financing. If your sources exceed your uses, you have miscalculated somewhere. If your uses exceed your sources, the deal cannot close as structured.

The beauty of this framework is its flexibility. The same target company can be acquired with vastly different financing structures. A conservative buyer might use 40% debt and 60% equity. An aggressive buyer might push to 70% debt and 30% equity. Both structures satisfy the Sources = Uses equation, but they produce dramatically different return profiles and risk characteristics.

### Components of Sources

Sources represent where the money comes from to fund the acquisition. In a typical LBO, sources include:

**Debt financing** constitutes the leveraged portion of the capital structure. This may include senior secured term loans, subordinated debt, mezzanine financing, or high-yield bonds. Each instrument carries different costs, covenants, and repayment terms. The mix of debt instruments is a critical structuring decision that affects both returns and risk.

**Equity contribution** represents the sponsor's investment. This is the check the private equity firm writes to close the transaction. The equity contribution is the residual after debt financing—whatever the debt markets will not fund, the sponsor must cover. This is why equity is often called the "plug" in Sources and Uses.

**Rollover equity** occurs when existing shareholders retain an ownership stake rather than cashing out entirely. Management teams frequently roll over equity to maintain alignment with the new owners. Rollover equity reduces the cash needed from other sources but creates complexity in calculating true sponsor returns.

**Excess cash on the balance sheet** can sometimes be used to fund a portion of the acquisition. If the target company has $50 million in cash beyond what is needed for operations, that cash effectively reduces the purchase price from the buyer's perspective.

### Components of Uses

Uses represent what the money is spent on. In a typical LBO, uses include:

**Purchase of equity** is the primary use—the amount paid to acquire all outstanding shares of the target company. For public companies, this is calculated from the offer price and shares outstanding. For private companies, this is typically the negotiated enterprise value adjusted for net debt.

**Refinancing of existing debt** is often required in LBO transactions. Lenders to the target company may have change-of-control provisions that trigger repayment upon acquisition. Even without such provisions, the sponsor typically refinances existing debt to optimize the capital structure.

**Transaction fees and expenses** include advisory fees (investment banking, legal, accounting), financing fees (arrangement fees, commitment fees), and other closing costs. These fees can be substantial—often 2-4% of transaction value—and must be funded at closing.

**Debt issuance costs and OID** (Original Issue Discount) represent the costs of raising debt financing. These are technically assets that are amortized over the life of the debt, but the cash outflow occurs at closing.

### How Sources and Uses Connects to the Model

The Sources and Uses schedule is not an isolated calculation. It provides critical inputs to multiple sections of the LBO model.

The **debt schedule** receives the opening debt balances directly from Sources. Each tranche of debt in Sources becomes a starting balance in the debt schedule, which then tracks interest payments and principal amortization over the projection period.

The **equity investment** from Sources flows to the returns analysis. The IRR calculation compares cash outflows (equity contribution at entry) to cash inflows (equity proceeds at exit). Without knowing the precise equity contribution, you cannot calculate returns.

The **goodwill calculation** depends on Sources and Uses. Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets. Transaction fees capitalized into the acquisition basis also affect goodwill. Understanding this linkage is essential for purchase accounting.

The **opening balance sheet** is constructed from the Sources and Uses schedule combined with purchase accounting adjustments. The debt balances, equity contribution, and goodwill all flow directly to the Day 1 balance sheet.

### Interview Implications

In interviews, you will be asked to walk through Sources and Uses in multiple contexts. You might be given a term sheet and asked to construct the Sources and Uses from scratch. You might be asked how Sources and Uses would change if the debt markets tightened. You might be asked to explain the relationship between Sources and Uses and the IRR formula.

The key is to demonstrate that you understand the conceptual framework, not just the mechanical calculation. Why does adding more debt increase sponsor returns? Because it reduces the equity check, and IRR is highly sensitive to the initial investment. Why do transaction fees reduce returns? Because they increase Uses without increasing the value of what you acquire.

When you can explain these relationships fluently, you demonstrate that you understand LBO mechanics at the level required to actually work on deals.
