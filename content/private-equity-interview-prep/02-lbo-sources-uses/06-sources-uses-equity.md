# Sources and Uses - Equity Contribution

## Learning Objectives

## Written Guide

### The Equity Check as the Plug

In every LBO, the equity contribution is calculated as a residual. After determining total Uses and maximizing available debt financing, the remaining amount must come from sponsor equity. This is why equity is called the "plug" in Sources and Uses.

Total Uses - Total Debt = Sponsor Equity Contribution

This simple equation has profound implications. The equity check is not chosen arbitrarily—it is determined by the intersection of purchase price, available debt capacity, and transaction costs. When debt markets tighten and leverage multiples compress, equity requirements increase. When debt markets are favorable, sponsors can acquire companies with smaller equity checks.

The size of the equity contribution directly affects returns. IRR is highly sensitive to the initial investment amount. All else equal, a smaller equity check produces higher returns because the denominator in the return calculation is smaller.

### Calculating the Equity Contribution

Consider a transaction with the following parameters:

**Uses:**
- Equity purchase price: $800 million
- Refinancing existing debt: $200 million
- Transaction fees: $40 million
- Financing fees: $20 million
- **Total Uses: $1,060 million**

**Sources (Debt):**
- Term Loan B: $500 million
- Second Lien: $100 million
- **Total Debt: $600 million**

**Sponsor Equity:**
$1,060 million - $600 million = **$460 million**

This $460 million represents the check the private equity fund must write at closing. It comes from the fund's committed capital and becomes the basis for calculating fund-level returns.

### Rollover Equity

Rollover equity occurs when existing shareholders retain a portion of their ownership rather than cashing out entirely. This is most common with management teams, who roll over equity to maintain alignment and demonstrate confidence in the go-forward strategy.

Rollover equity has important implications for Sources and Uses:

**In Sources:** Rollover equity appears as a separate line item alongside sponsor equity and debt. If management rolls $50 million of equity, total Sources increases by that amount (with a corresponding reduction in sponsor equity if Uses remains constant), or Uses increases by the same amount if management's rollover is in addition to the sponsor equity.

**In Uses:** The treatment depends on structuring. If rollover is considered part of the purchase price, Uses remains unchanged. If rollover is structured as a separate investment alongside the sponsor, the equity purchase price in Uses reflects only the cashed-out shareholders.

The cleaner conceptual treatment: rollover reduces the cash equity purchase price in Uses, and correspondingly reduces the sponsor equity required in Sources. If management owned $50 million of equity value and rolls 100% of it, the cash paid to shareholders decreases by $50 million, and the sponsor writes a check $50 million smaller.

### Impact on Returns Analysis

Rollover equity complicates returns analysis because the sponsor's returns differ from the total equity returns.

**Total Equity Returns:** Calculated on all equity in the deal, including rollover. If total equity (sponsor + management) of $460 million becomes $1.2 billion at exit, total equity MOIC is 2.6x.

**Sponsor Equity Returns:** Calculated only on the sponsor's investment. If the sponsor invested $400 million of the $460 million total equity, and receives $1.04 billion at exit (pro-rata share), sponsor MOIC is also 2.6x.

Returns diverge when economics differ:

**Management Sweet Equity:** Management often receives equity at below fair market value or with catch-up provisions that increase their share if returns exceed thresholds. This dilutes sponsor returns relative to total equity returns.

**Preferred Return Structures:** The sponsor might structure a preferred return or priority distribution that must be satisfied before management participates. This protects sponsor downside at the expense of management upside.

Understanding these dynamics is important for accurately calculating the returns that matter—sponsor returns—which drive fund performance.

### Co-Investment Structures

For larger transactions, a single fund may not have sufficient capital. Co-investment structures bring additional equity from various sources:

**LP Co-Investment:** Fund limited partners invest directly alongside the fund, typically on a no-fee, no-carry basis. This allows LPs to increase exposure to specific deals they find attractive while giving the GP access to additional capital. LP co-invest might provide 20-50% of total equity for larger deals.

**Club Deals:** Multiple private equity firms invest together, each writing a portion of the equity check. Club deals were more common before the financial crisis and have declined somewhat due to antitrust concerns and coordination challenges. However, they remain relevant for very large transactions.

**Sovereign Wealth Funds and Pension Funds:** Large institutional investors sometimes invest directly in private equity deals alongside sponsors, particularly for infrastructure or real asset transactions.

In Sources and Uses, co-investment appears as a separate line within equity:

- Sponsor Equity (Fund): $300 million
- LP Co-Investment: $100 million
- Management Rollover: $50 million
- **Total Equity: $450 million**

Each equity source has different return expectations and fee structures. The GP typically earns management fees and carried interest only on fund capital, not on co-investment or rollover.

### Minimum Equity Requirements

Certain transactions have minimum equity requirements beyond what the debt math implies:

**Lender Requirements:** Senior lenders often require minimum equity cushions (typically 30-40% of total capitalization) to protect their position. Even if debt markets would theoretically support higher leverage, lenders may cap loan amounts based on equity percentages.

**Regulatory Requirements:** Bank holding company acquisitions and certain regulated industries have minimum equity requirements set by regulators.

**Seller Requirements:** Sellers, particularly in take-private transactions, may require minimum equity commitments from sponsors as part of the deal certainty assessment. A seller may prefer a bidder with committed equity financing over one relying heavily on debt markets.

These requirements can constrain deal structuring even when pure leverage arithmetic suggests lower equity would be sufficient.

### Committed vs. Funded Equity

An important distinction in larger transactions is between committed equity and funded equity at close.

**Committed Equity:** The total amount the sponsor agrees to invest, including amounts that may be drawn post-close for add-on acquisitions or other purposes.

**Funded Equity:** The amount actually funded at closing, which appears in Sources.

The commitment letter from the sponsor typically specifies both amounts. The funded amount goes into Sources and Uses; the committed amount provides the seller with comfort that capital is available for future needs.

### Interview Considerations

Equity questions in interviews often probe understanding of the interactions between debt and equity:

"If leverage decreases by 1x EBITDA, how does that affect the equity check?"
The sponsor must fund the difference. If EBITDA is $100 million and leverage drops from 6x to 5x, debt decreases by $100 million, requiring $100 million more equity.

"How does rollover affect sponsor returns?"
Rollover reduces the sponsor's equity check, which can increase sponsor IRR if the rollover is not dilutive to proceeds. However, if rollover comes with preferential economics, sponsor returns may be diluted.

"Why would a sponsor prefer more leverage?"
Higher leverage reduces the equity check, which increases IRR for a given exit value. However, it also increases risk through higher fixed charges and covenant constraints.

These questions test whether you understand the mechanics and can reason through implications.

## Key Takeaways

- Equity contribution is calculated as Total Uses minus Total Debt—it is the residual "plug" in Sources and Uses
- Smaller equity checks produce higher IRRs because the denominator in the return calculation decreases
- Rollover equity reduces cash Uses and correspondingly reduces required sponsor equity
- Sponsor returns may differ from total equity returns when management has preferential economics (sweet equity, catch-up provisions)
- Co-investment structures (LP co-invest, club deals) provide additional equity capacity for larger transactions
- Minimum equity requirements from lenders (30-40% cushion), regulators, or sellers may constrain leverage even when debt markets would support more
