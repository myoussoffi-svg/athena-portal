- Recognize how Uses directly impact goodwill and the opening balance sheet

## Written Guide

### The Complete Uses Framework

The Uses side of Sources and Uses answers a fundamental question: what exactly is all the money being spent on? While "buying the company" is the intuitive answer, the reality is more complex. Uses include not only the purchase price but also debt refinancing, transaction expenses, and financing costs. Missing any component leads to an inaccurate equity calculation and, consequently, incorrect returns.

A complete Uses framework includes:

1. Equity Purchase Price
2. Refinancing of Existing Debt
3. Transaction Fees and Expenses
4. Financing Fees and Debt Issuance Costs
5. Other Uses (cash to balance sheet, escrow, etc.)

Each category requires careful analysis to ensure nothing is overlooked.

### Equity Purchase Price

The equity purchase price is the largest component of Uses. It represents the amount paid to existing equity holders to acquire their ownership stakes.

For a **public company**, equity purchase price equals:
- Offer Price per Share × Diluted Shares Outstanding
- Plus: Cash paid to option holders (intrinsic value of in-the-money options)
- Less: Any shares owned by the buyer or rollover shareholders

For a **private company**, equity purchase price equals:
- Negotiated Enterprise Value
- Less: Net Debt at closing (debt assumed - cash retained)
- Adjusted for working capital true-ups

Working capital adjustments are common in private transactions. The purchase agreement specifies a target working capital level. If actual working capital at closing exceeds the target, the buyer pays more; if it falls short, the buyer pays less. This true-up can add or subtract from the equity purchase price.

### Refinancing Existing Debt

Many LBO transactions require refinancing the target's existing debt. This occurs for several reasons:

**Change of Control Provisions:** Most loan agreements include provisions that trigger repayment upon change of control. The acquisition itself triggers the requirement to repay.

**Optimal Capital Structure:** Even without change of control provisions, the sponsor typically refinances existing debt to establish the desired post-acquisition capital structure with appropriate terms, covenants, and maturity profiles.

**Bank Relationships:** The sponsor's relationship banks often provide the new financing, replacing the target's existing lenders.

Debt refinancing appears on both sides of Sources and Uses:
- **Uses:** Repayment of existing debt (cash outflow at closing)
- **Sources:** New debt financing (cash inflow at closing)

The net effect is that only the incremental new debt adds to sponsor leverage capacity.

Consider a target with $300 million of existing debt being refinanced with $500 million of new debt:
- Uses include: Refinancing existing debt: $300 million
- Sources include: New term loan: $500 million
- Net incremental debt: $200 million

This $200 million of incremental debt reduces the required equity contribution.

### Transaction Fees and Expenses

Transaction fees are substantial in LBO transactions, often totaling 2-4% of enterprise value. These fees include:

**Advisory Fees:**
- Investment banking fees for M&A advice (typically 0.5-1.5% of EV)
- Legal fees for buyer and seller (significant but smaller than banking fees)
- Accounting fees for due diligence and audits
- Other advisors: tax, insurance, environmental, etc.

**Seller Transaction Fees:** In some cases, the buyer agrees to pay or reimburse seller fees. These increase Uses beyond the equity purchase price.

The treatment of transaction fees matters for both accounting and taxes:

**Capitalized Fees:** Under acquisition accounting, certain transaction fees are capitalized as part of the acquisition basis, increasing goodwill.

**Expensed Fees:** Other fees must be expensed in the year incurred (under ASC 805, most acquirer transaction costs are expensed).

**Tax Treatment:** Some transaction fees are immediately deductible; others must be capitalized and amortized over time. The specifics depend on the type of fee and the structure of the transaction.

For Sources and Uses purposes, all transaction fees appear in Uses regardless of accounting treatment, because they represent cash outflows at closing.

### Financing Fees and Debt Issuance Costs

Raising debt financing involves fees separate from the transaction advisory fees:

**Arrangement Fees:** Paid to lead arrangers for structuring and syndicating debt. Typically 1.5-2.5% of committed debt.

**Underwriting Fees:** Paid when banks underwrite (guarantee) the debt placement. Included in arrangement fees or charged separately.

**Commitment Fees:** Ongoing fees for undrawn revolving credit capacity. These are not closing costs but accrue over time.

**Original Issue Discount (OID):** Institutional debt is often issued at a discount. A loan with 2 points of OID has proceeds of 98% of face value but the borrower owes 100%.

Financing fees are capitalized and amortized over the life of the debt under GAAP. They appear as an asset (deferred financing costs) or as a contra-liability (reduction in debt balance) on the balance sheet.

In Sources and Uses, financing fees appear in Uses. Importantly, the debt amount in Sources should be the face value (not net proceeds) when OID is shown separately in Uses. Alternatively, you can show debt at net proceeds and exclude OID from Uses—just be consistent.

### Other Uses

Several other items may appear in Uses depending on deal structure:

**Cash to Balance Sheet:** If the sponsor wants to close with a specific cash balance (for liquidity or working capital purposes), this cash requirement appears in Uses.

**Escrow and Holdback:** Portions of the purchase price may be placed in escrow pending resolution of specific issues (working capital true-up, indemnification claims). Escrow amounts still appear in Uses because cash is disbursed from Sources at closing.

**Call Premiums:** If existing debt includes make-whole provisions or call premiums, these additional costs appear in Uses.

**Accrued Interest:** Interest accrued on existing debt between the last payment date and closing is typically paid at refinancing.

**Lease Buyouts:** If the transaction involves buying out unfavorable leases, these payments appear in Uses.

### Complete Sources and Uses Example

Bringing everything together, a complete Sources and Uses table might look like this:

**USES**
| Item | Amount ($M) |
|------|-------------|
| Equity Purchase Price | 800.0 |
| Refinancing Existing Debt | 250.0 |
| M&A Advisory Fees | 15.0 |
| Legal & Other Transaction Fees | 8.0 |
| Debt Arrangement Fees | 12.0 |
| OID (2 points on TLB) | 10.0 |
| **Total Uses** | **1,095.0** |

**SOURCES**
| Item | Amount ($M) |
|------|-------------|
| Term Loan B | 500.0 |
| Second Lien Loan | 100.0 |
| Revolver (undrawn) | 0.0 |
| Sponsor Equity | 440.0 |
| Management Rollover | 55.0 |
| **Total Sources** | **1,095.0** |

This example shows how everything balances. The sponsor's equity check of $440 million is determined by the total Uses less all other Sources.

### Impact on Goodwill and Opening Balance Sheet

Uses directly affects the goodwill calculation and opening balance sheet:

**Goodwill Impact:** Goodwill equals the purchase price (plus certain capitalized costs) minus the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired. Higher Uses related to the acquisition basis increases goodwill.

**Balance Sheet Construction:** The closing balance sheet reflects:
- New debt at face value (or net of OID depending on presentation)
- Contributed equity
- Purchase accounting adjustments to assets and liabilities
- Goodwill as the plug to balance

Understanding how Uses flows to the balance sheet is essential for purchase accounting, which we cover in subsequent lessons.

- Transaction fees (advisory, legal, accounting) are cash outflows at closing regardless of whether they are capitalized or expensed for accounting purposes
- Financing fees (arrangement fees, OID) are capitalized and amortized over the debt life but represent closing cash needs
- The complete Uses calculation determines the required equity contribution and must capture every cash requirement at closing
- Uses directly impacts goodwill (purchase price less fair value of net assets) and the construction of the opening balance sheet
