- Connect individual model components into a coherent analytical framework

## Written Guide

### The Interview Question You Must Master

"Walk me through an LBO" is perhaps the most common technical question in private equity interviews. It appears in virtually every process, from mega-funds to lower middle market firms. Your ability to answer this question fluently—without hesitation, with appropriate technical depth, and with clear logical progression—signals whether you truly understand the mechanics or have merely memorized surface-level concepts.

The challenge is that an LBO model contains dozens of interconnected calculations. You cannot simply list components randomly. You must demonstrate that you understand the logical flow: what comes first, what depends on what, and how everything connects to produce the ultimate output of sponsor returns.

### Step 1: Establish the Purchase Price

Every LBO begins with determining what you are paying for the company. This requires calculating enterprise value and equity value.

For a public company, you start with the offer price per share multiplied by diluted shares outstanding. This gives you the equity value—what you are paying to acquire all shareholder claims. You then add net debt (total debt minus cash) to arrive at enterprise value. The offer price typically includes a premium to the current trading price, often 20-40% for control transactions.

For a private company, the starting point is usually an EBITDA multiple. If the target generates $100 million of EBITDA and the agreed purchase multiple is 10x, the enterprise value is $1 billion. You then subtract net debt to determine the equity purchase price.

This calculation matters because every subsequent number in the model flows from the purchase price. The debt capacity, the equity check, the goodwill—all are derivatives of this initial valuation.

### Step 2: Structure the Financing (Sources and Uses)

With the purchase price established, you must determine how to fund the acquisition. This is the Sources and Uses schedule.

Uses include the equity purchase price, refinancing of existing debt (if required), transaction fees, and financing costs. Sum these to get total Uses.

Sources include the various debt tranches and the equity contribution. A typical structure might include senior secured term loans, a revolving credit facility (often undrawn at close), and potentially subordinated debt or mezzanine financing. The mix depends on the company's cash flow characteristics, the lending environment, and the sponsor's risk tolerance.

The equity contribution is calculated as the residual: Total Uses minus Total Debt equals Sponsor Equity. This is why equity is called the "plug"—it absorbs whatever the debt markets will not fund.

A critical concept here is leverage capacity. Lenders typically underwrite to debt-to-EBITDA multiples (often 4-6x for senior debt) and interest coverage ratios. If the target has $100 million of EBITDA and lenders will extend 5x leverage, maximum senior debt is $500 million. This constraint shapes the entire capital structure.

### Step 3: Build the Operating Model

The operating model projects the company's financial performance over the holding period, typically five years. This is where you forecast revenue growth, margin improvement, and working capital dynamics.

Revenue projections might assume organic growth of 3-5% annually, supplemented by strategic initiatives or market expansion. EBITDA margins might improve through operational efficiencies, procurement savings, or scale benefits. These assumptions directly impact cash flow generation and, ultimately, sponsor returns.

The income statement flows from revenue through operating expenses to EBITDA, then subtracts depreciation and amortization to reach operating income (EBIT). Interest expense comes from the debt schedule. After taxes, you arrive at net income.

The balance sheet tracks assets and liabilities over time. Working capital changes flow from operating assumptions. PP&E reflects capital expenditures and depreciation. Debt balances come from the debt schedule.

### Step 4: Calculate Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow determines how much cash is available for debt repayment. This is calculated as:

EBITDA
- Cash Interest Expense
- Cash Taxes
- Capital Expenditures
- Increase in Net Working Capital
= Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow is the lifeblood of an LBO. Strong free cash flow allows rapid debt paydown, which increases equity value and drives returns. Weak free cash flow constrains debt repayment and may require additional equity or covenant waivers.

The relationship between EBITDA and free cash flow conversion is critical. A company with high capital intensity or significant working capital needs will convert less EBITDA to free cash flow than a capital-light business with stable working capital.

### Step 5: Build the Debt Schedule

The debt schedule tracks each tranche of debt over the holding period. For each year, you calculate:

- Beginning balance
- Mandatory amortization (scheduled principal payments)
- Optional prepayments (from excess cash flow)
- Interest expense
- Ending balance

Different debt tranches have different characteristics. Senior term loans typically amortize 1-5% annually with the remainder due at maturity. Revolving credit facilities are drawn and repaid based on cash needs. Subordinated debt may be bullet maturity with PIK (payment-in-kind) interest.

The debt schedule connects directly to the income statement (interest expense) and balance sheet (debt balances). It also determines how much debt remains at exit, which affects equity proceeds.

### Step 6: Determine Exit Value

After the projection period (typically five years), the sponsor exits the investment. Exit value is usually calculated by applying an EBITDA multiple to the exit year EBITDA.

If exit year EBITDA is $150 million and the assumed exit multiple is 10x, enterprise value at exit is $1.5 billion. The exit multiple might equal the entry multiple (no multiple expansion), exceed it (multiple expansion), or fall below it (multiple contraction).

From enterprise value, you subtract net debt at exit to determine equity proceeds. If exit enterprise value is $1.5 billion and remaining net debt is $400 million, equity proceeds are $1.1 billion.

### Step 7: Calculate Returns

Returns are calculated by comparing the equity investment to equity proceeds. The two primary metrics are IRR and MOIC.

**IRR (Internal Rate of Return)** is the annualized return that equates the present value of cash inflows to cash outflows. If you invest $400 million and receive $1.1 billion five years later, the IRR is approximately 22%.

**MOIC (Multiple of Invested Capital)** is simply proceeds divided by investment. $1.1 billion divided by $400 million equals 2.75x MOIC.

Both metrics matter. IRR captures time value—a 2.0x return in three years is more attractive than 2.0x in seven years. MOIC captures absolute value creation regardless of timing. PE firms typically target 20%+ IRR and 2.0-3.0x MOIC.

### The Complete Verbal Walkthrough

When asked to walk through an LBO in an interview, structure your response as follows:

"An LBO begins with determining the purchase price. For a public company, I'd calculate equity value from the offer price times diluted shares, then add net debt to get enterprise value. For a private company, I'd apply an EBITDA multiple to derive enterprise value.

Next, I'd build the Sources and Uses. Uses include the equity purchase price, any debt refinancing, and transaction fees. Sources include the debt financing—typically senior secured term loans, potentially subordinated debt—and the sponsor equity contribution, which is the plug.

I'd then build an operating model projecting revenue, EBITDA, and working capital over the five-year holding period. From the operating model, I'd calculate free cash flow: EBITDA minus cash interest, cash taxes, capex, and changes in working capital.

Free cash flow feeds the debt schedule, which tracks beginning balances, amortization, optional prepayments, interest expense, and ending balances for each debt tranche. The debt schedule determines remaining debt at exit.

At exit, I'd apply an EBITDA multiple to exit year EBITDA to get enterprise value. Subtracting net debt gives equity proceeds.

Finally, I'd calculate returns by comparing equity proceeds to the initial equity investment. IRR measures the annualized return; MOIC measures the absolute multiple. Strong LBOs target 20%+ IRR and 2.0x+ MOIC."

This response demonstrates technical fluency, logical structure, and understanding of how the pieces connect.
