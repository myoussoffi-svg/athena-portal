## Written Guide

### The Operating Model as the Engine

The operating model is where the investment thesis comes to life. It translates qualitative views about the business—market growth, operational improvements, pricing power—into quantitative projections that drive the entire LBO analysis. A poorly constructed operating model produces meaningless returns; a thoughtful operating model enables rigorous evaluation of an investment opportunity.

In private equity, the operating model serves multiple purposes. During diligence, it tests whether the investment thesis is achievable and quantifies the impact of value creation initiatives. Post-close, it becomes the basis for management incentives and performance tracking. In interviews, it demonstrates your ability to think critically about business drivers rather than simply manipulating spreadsheet formulas.

### Revenue Build

Revenue projections are the foundation of the operating model. There are several approaches to building revenue:

**Top-Down Approach:** Start with market size and growth, then estimate market share and share gains. This approach is useful for understanding the company's position within its industry but can obscure specific revenue drivers.

**Bottom-Up Approach:** Build revenue from underlying drivers—units sold, price per unit, number of customers, revenue per customer. This approach provides granularity and highlights operational levers.

**Segment-Level Analysis:** For diversified businesses, project each segment separately based on its specific drivers, then aggregate.

The bottom-up approach is generally preferred in LBO models because it connects directly to operational improvements the sponsor might drive.

Consider a B2B software company:
- Existing customers: 500
- Net customer additions: 25 per year (5% growth)
- Annual contract value (ACV): $100,000
- ACV growth: 5% annually (price increases + upsells)

Year 1 Revenue: 500 customers × $100,000 = $50 million
Year 5 Revenue: 610 customers × $122,000 = $74 million

This granular approach makes the assumptions explicit and testable. Is 5% customer growth realistic? What would drive higher ACV growth? The operating model facilitates these conversations.

### Cost Structure and Margins

Below revenue, the operating model projects costs to arrive at EBITDA. Cost structure modeling depends on the business type:

**Variable Costs:** Scale with revenue. Examples include raw materials, direct labor, and sales commissions. Model as a percentage of revenue or per-unit cost.

**Semi-Variable Costs:** Have both fixed and variable components. Examples include utilities, customer support, and fulfillment. Model with a fixed base plus a variable increment.

**Fixed Costs:** Do not vary with revenue in the short term. Examples include rent, executive salaries, and insurance. Model as specific line items with inflation or planned changes.

For the software company example:
- Cost of Goods Sold: 20% of revenue (hosting, support costs)
- Sales & Marketing: 30% of revenue (declining to 25% as customer base grows)
- R&D: 15% of revenue (maintaining product competitiveness)
- G&A: 10% of revenue (declining to 8% with scale)

EBITDA Margin Year 1: 100% - 20% - 30% - 15% - 10% = 25%
EBITDA Margin Year 5: 100% - 20% - 25% - 15% - 8% = 32%

This margin expansion represents a key value creation lever—the private equity sponsor would work with management to achieve these cost efficiencies.

### Operating Leverage

Operating leverage describes how profits change relative to revenue changes. Companies with high fixed costs have high operating leverage—their EBITDA grows faster than revenue when revenue increases, but also falls faster when revenue declines.

Understanding operating leverage is critical for LBO analysis because:

**Upside Sensitivity:** High operating leverage amplifies returns when the business performs well. A company with 70% fixed costs might see EBITDA grow 20% when revenue grows 10%.

**Downside Risk:** The same leverage works in reverse. If revenue declines 10%, EBITDA might decline 20%—potentially threatening debt service capacity.

Model the sensitivity explicitly:

| Revenue Change | Low Op Leverage (30% fixed) | High Op Leverage (70% fixed) |
|----------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| +10% Revenue   | +14% EBITDA                 | +25% EBITDA                 |
| -10% Revenue   | -14% EBITDA                 | -25% EBITDA                 |

Private equity sponsors often prefer businesses with moderate operating leverage—enough to benefit from growth but not so much that downturns cause severe distress.

### Synergies and Value Creation Initiatives

Unlike public company models, LBO operating models explicitly incorporate value creation initiatives. These might include:

**Revenue Synergies:** Cross-selling opportunities, geographic expansion, new product launches. Be conservative with revenue synergies—they are harder to achieve and take longer to materialize than cost synergies.

**Cost Synergies:** Procurement savings from scale, headcount reductions from automation, facility consolidation. Cost synergies are more reliable and can often be estimated with reasonable precision.

**Operational Improvements:** Pricing optimization, working capital efficiency, capex rationalization. These improvements may not appear as separate line items but flow through margin improvement or cash conversion.

Model synergies separately from the base case so you can see their impact clearly:

| | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
|---|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Base Case EBITDA | 50 | 55 | 60 | 65 | 70 |
| Procurement Savings | 0 | 3 | 5 | 5 | 5 |
| Org Restructuring | 0 | 2 | 4 | 4 | 4 |
| **Pro Forma EBITDA** | **50** | **60** | **69** | **74** | **79** |

This presentation shows that the pro forma case relies on $9 million of annual synergies by Year 3—a claim that can be validated through diligence.

### Below the Line: D&A, Interest, and Taxes

Below EBITDA, the operating model continues through to net income:

**Depreciation and Amortization:** D&A comes from the fixed asset schedule (for depreciation) and intangibles schedule (for amortization). In LBOs, amortization often increases due to asset write-ups under purchase accounting. Model D&A carefully because it affects taxes and covenant calculations.

**Interest Expense:** Interest expense comes from the debt schedule, creating the circular reference discussed previously. In an operating model, use estimated interest based on projected debt levels.

**Taxes:** Tax expense is calculated as pre-tax income multiplied by the effective tax rate. Interest expense is tax-deductible, so higher leverage reduces tax liability. The tax shield from debt is a significant component of LBO value creation.

Be aware of tax complications:
- Net operating loss carryforwards may shelter income
- Section 163(j) limits interest deductibility in some cases
- Depreciation and amortization create deferred tax assets/liabilities

For interview purposes, use a simplified effective tax rate. For real deal models, engage tax advisors.

### Connecting to Debt Capacity and Returns

The operating model directly determines debt capacity and returns:

**EBITDA drives leverage:** If lenders will extend 5x EBITDA and Year 1 EBITDA is $100 million, debt capacity is $500 million. Higher EBITDA means more debt capacity and a smaller equity check.

**Free cash flow drives debt paydown:** Strong operating performance generates free cash flow that pays down debt, increasing equity value at exit.

**Exit EBITDA drives exit value:** If exit multiple is 10x and Year 5 EBITDA is $150 million, exit enterprise value is $1.5 billion. Every dollar of EBITDA improvement is worth $10 at exit.

This connectivity means operating model assumptions directly impact returns. A 10% improvement in Year 5 EBITDA might increase IRR by 3-5 percentage points. The operating model is where value creation is quantified.

### Interview Considerations

Operating model questions test business judgment as much as technical skills:

"How would you project revenue for a subscription software business?"
I would use a cohort-based model: beginning subscribers, plus new additions, minus churn, multiplied by average revenue per user. I would project each driver separately based on historical trends and competitive dynamics.

"What margin improvement can you realistically achieve?"
It depends on the starting margin and business type. A company at 15% EBITDA margin might have 500-1000 bps of improvement potential over five years. A company already at 35% has less room. I would benchmark against best-in-class peers.

"How do you stress test the operating model?"
I would run sensitivities on key drivers: -10% revenue, -200 bps margin, 10% higher capex. I would also test specific scenarios like customer loss or input cost inflation. The goal is understanding where the model breaks.
