# Exit Strategies and Multiple Analysis

## Learning Objectives

- Explain the common exit strategies available to PE firms and when each is used
- Understand how to select and defend an exit multiple in an LBO model
- Evaluate exit timing considerations and their impact on returns
- Assess how exit strategy affects valuation and risk

## Written Guide

### PE Exit Strategies

PE firms hold investments for **3-7 years** on average and exit through one of several routes:

**1. Sale to a Strategic Buyer**:
- Selling the portfolio company to a corporation in the same or adjacent industry
- Strategic buyers may pay premiums for synergies (cost savings, revenue opportunities, vertical integration)
- Most common exit route
- Advantages: Often highest valuation, can close quickly
- Disadvantages: Strategic buyers are selective and timing-dependent

**2. Sale to Another Financial Sponsor (Secondary Buyout)**:
- Selling to another PE firm
- Common when the company is performing well but needs additional growth capital or operational improvements
- Advantages: Reliable exit route, sponsor buyers understand the business model
- Disadvantages: Lower premiums than strategic sales (no synergies)

**3. IPO (Initial Public Offering)**:
- Taking the company public through an equity offering
- Typically requires strong growth, scale, and market conditions
- Advantages: Can achieve high valuations, provides liquidity, allows partial exit
- Disadvantages: Expensive, time-consuming, requires ongoing public company compliance, lock-up periods delay full exit

**4. Dividend Recapitalization**:
- Raising new debt to pay a dividend to the PE firm
- Not a full exit, but returns capital while retaining ownership
- Advantages: Returns cash without selling the business
- Disadvantages: Increases leverage and risk, does not fully exit

**5. Sale to Management (Management Buyout)**:
- Selling the company to the management team
- Rare; typically only when other exit routes are unavailable
- Disadvantages: Management may not have capital; financing is difficult

### How to Select an Exit Multiple

The **exit multiple** is one of the most important (and most sensitive) assumptions in an LBO model. How do you choose it?

**Start with the entry multiple**:
- As a baseline, assume exit multiple = entry multiple (no multiple expansion or contraction)
- This is conservative and defensible

**Adjust for business quality improvements**:
- If the company will have higher growth, better margins, or stronger market position at exit, a modest premium (0.5-1.0 turn) may be justified
- If the business deteriorates, a lower multiple is appropriate

**Consider market conditions**:
- Exit multiples are market-dependent. If valuations are elevated at entry, they may compress by exit.
- If you're underwriting during a hot market, consider assuming a lower exit multiple (e.g., entry 11×, exit 10×)

**Reference comps and precedent transactions**:
- Look at recent M&A multiples for comparable companies
- If comps are trading at 9-11× EBITDA, exiting at 10× is reasonable

**Avoid aggressive assumptions**:
- Assuming multiple expansion (e.g., entry 8×, exit 10×) is aggressive unless you have a clear story
- Interviewers will challenge aggressive assumptions

**Typical range**: For interview purposes, exit multiples are often 0.5-1.0 turn lower than entry multiples to be conservative.

### Exit Timing Considerations

**Why 5 years?**:
- 5-year hold periods are standard for modeling purposes
- In reality, PE firms exit when market conditions and business performance align

**Shorter holds (3-4 years)**:
- Possible if the company outperforms quickly or market conditions are favorable
- Increases IRR (same MOIC, less time)

**Longer holds (6-7+ years)**:
- Necessary if the business needs more time to improve or markets are weak
- Decreases IRR (same MOIC, more time)

**Timing flexibility is valuable**: PE firms can choose when to exit, unlike public market investors.

### How Exit Strategy Affects Valuation

Different exit routes imply different valuations:

**Strategic sale**: Typically highest valuation due to synergies. May justify a modest premium to market multiples.

**Sponsor sale**: Market-level valuation, no synergy premium. Assume exit multiple ≈ entry multiple or slightly lower.

**IPO**: Can achieve high valuations in strong markets, but requires scale and growth. IPO costs and lock-up periods reduce net proceeds.

**Dividend recap**: Does not change exit valuation but increases leverage, which increases risk.

In an LBO model, you typically assume a sale (strategic or sponsor), not an IPO, unless the case specifies otherwise.

### Defending Your Exit Assumptions

Interviewers will ask: "Why did you assume an 9.0× exit multiple?"

**Strong answer**:

"I assumed a 9.0× exit multiple, which is slightly below the 9.5× entry multiple. I'm being conservative because I don't want to rely on multiple expansion. The company's improved margins and market position could support a market-level multiple at exit, but I prefer not to underwrite multiple expansion. If the business performs well and markets are strong, we could exit at 10×, which would increase IRR to 25%+."

**Weak answer**:

"I just used the same multiple as entry."

### Common Mistakes

**Assuming multiple expansion without justification**: Exit multiple > entry multiple is aggressive and will be challenged.

**Not linking exit multiple to business quality**: If the business improves significantly, a higher exit multiple may be justified. If it stagnates, a lower multiple is appropriate.

**Ignoring market conditions**: Exit multiples are cyclical. If you're underwriting at a market peak, be conservative.

**Not sensitizing the exit multiple**: Show how returns change if the exit multiple is 8×, 9×, or 10×. This demonstrates awareness of risk.

**Outline**:
- PE exit strategies: strategic sale, sponsor sale, IPO, dividend recap
- How to select an exit multiple: start with entry, adjust for business quality, reference comps, be conservative
- Exit timing considerations: 3-7 year holds, impact on IRR
- How exit strategy affects valuation: strategic sales highest, sponsor sales market-level
- Defending exit assumptions when challenged
- Common mistakes: assuming multiple expansion, not sensitizing

**Suggested Length**: 10 minutes

## Key Takeaways

- Common PE exits: strategic sale (highest valuation), sponsor sale (market-level), IPO (requires scale and strong markets), dividend recap (partial exit)
- Start with exit multiple = entry multiple; adjust conservatively for business improvements
- Avoid assuming multiple expansion unless you have a clear, defensible story
- Reference comps and precedent transactions to justify your exit multiple
- Standard hold period is 5 years; shorter holds increase IRR, longer holds decrease IRR
- Sensitize exit multiple to show awareness of risk and variability
