- Build intuition for how PE professionals think about capital structure optimization

## Written Guide

### Why Debt Schedules Matter in Private Equity

When a private equity firm acquires a company through a leveraged buyout, the transaction's success hinges on two interconnected mechanics: the company's ability to service and repay debt, and the returns generated for the equity investors. The debt schedule sits at the heart of both calculations, serving as the engine that translates operating performance into equity value creation.

Think of the debt schedule as the financial nervous system of an LBO model. Every dollar of EBITDA the company generates flows through the debt schedule before reaching equity holders. The schedule tracks interest payments, mandatory amortization, optional prepayments, and covenant compliance. It determines how quickly the company deleverages, how much cash is available for reinvestment, and ultimately, how much equity value is created over the holding period.

In interviews, you will encounter questions that test your understanding of these mechanics at multiple levels. At the surface level, interviewers want to know you can build a debt schedule that balances and flows correctly. At a deeper level, they are assessing whether you understand how different debt structures affect returns and how PE sponsors think about optimizing capital structure.

### The Fundamental Economics of LBOs

The power of leverage in buyouts comes from a straightforward principle: when you finance an acquisition with borrowed money and the company earns a return higher than the cost of debt, the excess return accrues entirely to equity holders. This concept, often called the "leveraged return," is the mathematical foundation of PE investing.

Consider a simplified example. A PE firm acquires a company for $500 million, financing the purchase with $300 million of debt at 8% interest and $200 million of equity. If the company generates $60 million of annual free cash flow (after interest), that entire amount flows to equity holders for reinvestment or debt paydown. Over five years, aggressive debt repayment can reduce the debt balance significantly, meaning equity holders capture an increasing share of enterprise value.

The debt schedule tracks this value transfer year by year. It calculates interest expense based on beginning balances and applicable rates, determines mandatory amortization, and computes optional prepayments from excess cash flow. The ending debt balance feeds into the next period's beginning balance, creating the iterative structure that makes LBO models circular in nature.

### Components of the Debt Schedule

A complete debt schedule in an LBO model typically includes several distinct tranches, each with different terms, rates, and repayment mechanics. Understanding these components is essential for both modeling and interviews.

**Senior Secured Debt** represents the highest priority claims, typically including a revolving credit facility and term loans. The revolver functions like a corporate credit card, providing liquidity when needed and requiring no amortization. Term Loan A often amortizes over its life, while Term Loan B typically features minimal amortization with a bullet maturity.

**Subordinated Debt** sits below senior debt in the capital structure and carries higher interest rates to compensate for increased risk. This may include senior notes, subordinated notes, or mezzanine financing. Some tranches may include payment-in-kind (PIK) interest, where interest accrues and compounds rather than being paid in cash.

**Preferred Equity** occupies a hybrid position between debt and common equity. While technically equity, preferred stock often functions like debt with fixed dividend rates and liquidation preferences.

### Connecting Debt to Returns

The relationship between debt and returns flows through several channels. First, initial leverage determines how much equity is required at entry. A transaction with 60% debt financing requires only 40% of enterprise value as equity, amplifying returns if the investment performs well.

Second, the rate of debt paydown determines how equity value builds over time. Consider two scenarios for a company acquired at $500 million. In Scenario A, the company pays down $150 million of debt over five years through mandatory amortization and cash sweeps. In Scenario B, the same company maintains its debt balance with minimal amortization. If both companies are sold at the same $600 million enterprise value, Scenario A delivers significantly higher equity proceeds because debt claims have been reduced.

Third, the cost of debt directly reduces cash available for equity. Higher interest rates mean lower free cash flow, slower debt paydown, and reduced returns. This is why PE firms spend considerable effort negotiating debt terms and monitoring interest rate exposure.

### Building Intuition for Interviews

PE interviewers expect you to understand these relationships intuitively, not just mechanically. When asked how changing a debt structure affects returns, you should be able to reason through the impact without building a model.

For example, if an interviewer asks: "We are considering adding a $50 million PIK note to the capital structure instead of cash-pay debt. How does this affect our returns?"

Your answer should address multiple dimensions: PIK reduces near-term cash interest expense, leaving more cash flow for operations or debt paydown elsewhere in the structure. However, the PIK balance grows over time as interest compounds, increasing the total debt burden at exit. The net impact depends on the PIK rate versus the rate on debt that would otherwise be paid down, and on exit timing. Shorter holds favor PIK (less compounding), while longer holds may suffer from balance growth.

This type of structured thinking, walking through the mechanics and identifying the key variables, demonstrates the analytical approach PE firms value in their investment professionals.

### The Road Ahead in This Module

The lessons that follow will build systematically on this foundation. You will learn the mechanics of debt schedule construction, from revolver modeling to complex debt waterfalls. You will master PIK interest calculations and understand when PIK enhances versus destroys value. Most critically, you will develop deep expertise in IRR and MOIC calculations, including the mental math shortcuts that PE professionals use to evaluate investments quickly.

By the end of this module, you should be able to build a complete debt schedule from scratch, calculate returns under various scenarios, and articulate how capital structure decisions affect equity value creation. These skills are not merely interview preparation; they are the core competencies that PE professionals use daily to evaluate and optimize investments.

## Key Takeaways

- The debt schedule is the central engine of an LBO model, translating operating performance into equity returns
- Leverage amplifies returns when company performance exceeds the cost of debt, but magnifies losses when performance disappoints
- Understanding debt tranches (senior secured, subordinated, preferred) and their distinct mechanics is essential for interviews
- The relationship between debt structure and returns flows through initial leverage, debt paydown rates, and interest costs
- PE interviewers test intuitive understanding of these relationships, not just mechanical modeling ability
- Developing the ability to reason through capital structure changes without a model is a critical interview skill
