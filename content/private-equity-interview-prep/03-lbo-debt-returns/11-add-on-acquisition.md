### The Strategic Logic of Add-On Acquisitions

Private equity's buy-and-build strategy involves acquiring a "platform" company and subsequently executing multiple smaller "add-on" or "bolt-on" acquisitions to build scale, capabilities, or geographic reach. This approach has become one of the most prevalent value creation strategies in middle-market PE, often accounting for a significant portion of EBITDA growth during the holding period.

The strategic rationale is straightforward: smaller companies typically trade at lower valuation multiples than larger companies. If a PE firm acquires small businesses at 5-6x EBITDA and integrates them into a platform valued at 8-10x EBITDA, the resulting multiple arbitrage creates immediate equity value. Beyond the multiple arbitrage, successful integration can generate revenue synergies (cross-selling, geographic expansion) and cost synergies (overhead consolidation, procurement leverage).

For interviews, understanding both the strategic logic and the financial mechanics of add-ons is essential, as this is a core PE value creation lever.

### Financial Impact: The Accretion Analysis

When evaluating an add-on acquisition, sponsors analyze whether the transaction is accretive to equity returns. The key factors are:

**Purchase Multiple vs. Platform Multiple**: If the add-on is acquired at a lower multiple than the platform, there is immediate multiple arbitrage value creation.

**Funding Cost**: Whether the add-on is funded with platform cash, additional debt, or sponsor equity affects returns differently.

**Synergies**: Cost savings or revenue enhancements increase the effective EBITDA acquired.

**Worked Example: Add-On Accretion**

Platform Company (Year 2 of hold):
- EBITDA: $75 million
- EV: $600 million (8.0x multiple)
- Debt: $350 million
- Equity Value: $250 million

Add-On Target:
- EBITDA: $15 million
- Purchase Price: $82.5 million (5.5x multiple)
- Expected Synergies: $3 million annual cost savings
- Funding: 50% new debt ($41.25M), 50% platform cash ($41.25M)

Post-Acquisition Combined Company:
- Pro Forma EBITDA: $75M + $15M + $3M synergies = $93 million
- EV at Platform Multiple (8.0x): $93M x 8.0 = $744 million
- Debt: $350M + $41.25M = $391.25 million
- Equity Value: $744M - $391.25M = $352.75 million
- Cash Used: $41.25 million
- Net Equity Value: $352.75M - $0 (cash already deployed) = $352.75M

Value Created:
- Pre-acquisition equity: $250M + $41.25M cash = $291.25M
- Post-acquisition equity: $352.75M
- Accretion: $61.5 million

The add-on created $61.5 million of equity value, representing a 21% increase from the pre-acquisition position. This accretion comes from multiple arbitrage (buying at 5.5x, valuing at 8.0x) and synergy capture.

### Sources of Add-On Value Creation

**Multiple Arbitrage**: The most direct source of value. If the platform trades at 10x and add-ons are acquired at 6x, every dollar of acquired EBITDA creates $4 of enterprise value ($10 value minus $6 cost).

Arbitrage Value = Acquired EBITDA x (Platform Multiple - Acquisition Multiple)

Using our example: $15M x (8.0 - 5.5) = $37.5 million

**Synergies**: Cost synergies (redundant corporate overhead, facilities, vendor consolidation) and revenue synergies (cross-selling, expanded capabilities) increase the effective EBITDA acquired.

Synergy Value = Annual Synergies x Platform Multiple
$3M x 8.0 = $24 million

**Scale Benefits**: Larger companies often command premium multiples due to reduced risk, improved liquidity, and institutional investor interest. Building scale through add-ons can drive multiple expansion beyond what the math suggests.

### Funding Structure Analysis

How an add-on is funded significantly affects returns:

**Platform Cash**: Using balance sheet cash reduces the platform's equity value dollar-for-dollar before capturing add-on value. This is straightforward but reduces liquidity.

**Additional Debt**: Leveraging the add-on acquisition reduces sponsor cash outlay and can enhance returns if the incremental debt is accretive. The cost of additional debt must be weighed against synergy value.

**Sponsor Equity Contribution**: Additional sponsor equity increases the investment basis, requiring proportionally higher exit proceeds to maintain returns. This is typically used for larger add-ons where debt capacity is constrained.

**Rollover Equity from Sellers**: Target shareholders receive equity in the combined company, aligning incentives and reducing cash required.

**Return Impact by Funding Source**:

Consider a $30M add-on with $5M EBITDA, purchased at 6x and valued at 8x (platform multiple):

Value created: $5M x (8 - 6) = $10M

Funding Scenario 1 - All Debt:
- No additional equity invested
- Return on investment: Infinite (no new equity)
- Platform equity increases by $10M

Funding Scenario 2 - All Platform Cash:
- $30M cash deployed
- Net equity change: +$10M - $30M cash = ($20M) initially, but add-on value captures the $30M + $10M = $40M
- Effectively: $30M cash converted to $40M of equity value

Funding Scenario 3 - Sponsor Equity:
- $30M additional sponsor investment
- Return on incremental capital: ($40M - $30M) / $30M = 33% MOIC on add-on
- Must evaluate whether add-on return exceeds platform return

### Modeling Add-Ons in LBO Returns

When modeling add-ons in an LBO, incorporate the following elements:

**Timing**: Add-ons purchased earlier in the hold period contribute EBITDA for more years, generating more value through growth and debt paydown.

**EBITDA Build**: Show base platform EBITDA, add acquired EBITDA at purchase date, phase in synergies over an integration period (often 1-2 years).

**Debt Build**: Add new debt tranches with appropriate terms. Calculate incremental interest expense.

**Equity Build**: If sponsor contributes additional equity, track the increased investment basis for return calculations.

**Exit Value**: Apply exit multiple to fully synergized EBITDA, then deduct all debt to determine equity proceeds.

### Return on Incremental Capital

For sophisticated return analysis, calculate returns separately on initial investment and add-on investments:

**Platform Return**: Original investment to exit proceeds attributable to platform growth
**Add-On Return**: Incremental investment to incremental value created by add-ons
**Blended Return**: Total investment to total exit proceeds

This decomposition reveals whether add-ons are enhancing or diluting returns.

**Example**:

Platform:
- Year 0 equity investment: $150M
- Year 5 platform value (grown organically): $350M
- Platform-only MOIC: 2.33x

Add-On:
- Year 2 equity investment: $40M
- Year 5 value of add-on (with synergies): $120M
- Add-on MOIC: 3.0x

Combined:
- Total investment: $150M + $40M = $190M
- Total exit value: $350M + $120M = $470M
- Blended MOIC: 2.47x

The add-on's 3.0x return exceeded the platform's 2.33x return, improving the blended multiple from 2.33x to 2.47x. Add-ons are "accretive to returns" when their incremental MOIC exceeds the platform MOIC.

### Interview Application

**"How do add-ons create value in an LBO?"**

"Add-ons create value through three primary mechanisms. First, multiple arbitrage: smaller companies typically trade at lower multiples, so acquiring at 5-6x and integrating into an 8-10x platform creates immediate value. Second, synergies: cost savings from eliminating redundant overhead and revenue enhancement from expanded capabilities increase pro forma EBITDA. Third, scale benefits: the combined larger company may command a premium multiple at exit due to reduced risk and improved marketability."

**"We are considering a $50M add-on at 7x for our platform that trades at 9x. Is this accretive?"**

"Yes, the add-on is accretive due to multiple arbitrage. The target contributes $50M / 7 = $7.1M of EBITDA. Valued at the platform multiple of 9x, this EBITDA is worth $64M, creating $14M of value ($64M - $50M). However, we should also consider the funding cost, integration risks, and whether synergies are achievable. If we fund with 8% debt, the $4M annual interest expense needs to be weighed against the value creation."

**"Should we fund the add-on with debt or equity?"**

"Debt funding is generally preferred because it leverages the return without increasing our equity basis. If debt markets will provide $50M at acceptable terms and the combined company can service it, debt funding maximizes MOIC. However, if the add-on would push leverage above prudent levels or covenant constraints, equity may be necessary. In that case, we should evaluate whether the add-on's incremental return exceeds our hurdle rate for new capital."

**"Walk me through how you would model a Year 2 add-on in an LBO."**

"In Year 2, I would add the acquired EBITDA to the platform's projection, applying the acquisition multiple to determine enterprise value impact. I would add any new debt to the debt schedule and calculate incremental interest expense. If we are using platform cash, I would show the outflow in the cash flow statement. Synergies would phase in over 12-18 months based on management's integration plan. At exit, I would apply the exit multiple to the fully synergized combined EBITDA, deduct all debt including add-on financing, and calculate equity proceeds. For return calculation, I would include any sponsor equity contribution for the add-on as an outflow in Year 2, affecting both MOIC and IRR."
