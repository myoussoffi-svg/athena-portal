# Sector-Specific Modeling Considerations

## Learning Objectives

- Apply sector-specific valuation methodologies and operating metrics to LBO models
- Understand how different business models affect cash flow timing and predictability
- Identify key value drivers and risks unique to software, healthcare, and industrial businesses
- Adjust modeling assumptions to reflect sector-specific characteristics

## Written Guide

### Why Sector Matters

A software company, a healthcare services provider, and an industrial manufacturer might all generate $50 million of EBITDA—but they are fundamentally different businesses with different risk profiles, growth trajectories, and value drivers. The same LBO structure that works brilliantly for recurring revenue software would be inappropriate for a cyclical industrial business.

As you advance from generalist banking to specialized PE roles, sector expertise becomes a differentiator. Understanding how to model different business types—and articulating why those differences matter—demonstrates the sophistication that firms seek in associates.

### Software and Technology

Software businesses have become the most sought-after PE targets because of their combination of recurring revenue, high margins, and operational leverage. But modeling software requires understanding its unique characteristics.

**Recurring revenue and retention metrics** drive software valuation. A company with $100 million ARR and 95% net revenue retention is worth materially more than one with $100 million of non-recurring revenue. Your model should project ARR growth, incorporating gross retention (logo churn) and expansion revenue (upsell and cross-sell). Net revenue retention above 100% means the existing customer base grows without acquiring new customers.

**Rule of 40** provides a rough benchmark: revenue growth rate plus EBITDA margin should exceed 40%. A company growing 30% with 15% margins (45% Rule of 40) is valued more highly than one growing 10% with 25% margins (35% Rule of 40).

**Customer acquisition economics** matter enormously. Track CAC (customer acquisition cost), LTV (lifetime value), and the LTV/CAC ratio. Payback periods on customer acquisition spending affect cash flow timing and investment requirements.

**Deferred revenue** creates a unique working capital dynamic. Software companies often collect annual subscriptions upfront, recording cash immediately but recognizing revenue over twelve months. This creates negative working capital—the company funds operations with customer prepayments. Your model should reflect this cash timing advantage.

Valuation methodologies emphasize revenue multiples, particularly for high-growth companies where EBITDA is depressed by growth investments. A SaaS company might trade at 10x ARR despite modest EBITDA margins because the recurring revenue base will generate significant EBITDA as growth slows and the company optimizes for profitability.

### Healthcare Services

Healthcare combines recession-resistant demand with complex regulatory dynamics and reimbursement risk. Modeling healthcare businesses requires attention to these unique factors.

**Reimbursement and payer mix** determine unit economics. Revenue comes from government payers (Medicare, Medicaid), commercial insurers, and self-pay patients. Government reimbursement rates are set administratively and can change, creating regulatory risk. Commercial rates are negotiated and depend on provider leverage. Your model should sensitivity test reimbursement rate changes.

**Same-store versus new-unit growth** matters for multi-site healthcare businesses. An urgent care platform might grow 15% annually through new clinic openings, but same-store growth of 3-4% indicates underlying market dynamics. Model these growth components separately—new units require capital investment and ramp time.

**Capacity utilization** drives margins in asset-heavy healthcare businesses. A surgery center with 60% utilization has very different economics than one at 85% utilization. Fixed costs are absorbed across more procedures as utilization increases, dramatically expanding margins.

**Labor dynamics** are critical given healthcare's reliance on skilled professionals. Nurse and physician shortages affect wage inflation and staffing challenges. Your model should reflect realistic labor cost assumptions, particularly in the current environment.

**Quality metrics and value-based care** increasingly affect reimbursement. Payers are shifting from fee-for-service to outcomes-based payment. Healthcare businesses that can demonstrate quality outcomes have competitive advantages and reimbursement upside.

### Industrials and Manufacturing

Industrial businesses present different modeling challenges: capital intensity, cyclicality, and operational complexity. Success requires understanding these dynamics.

**Cyclicality** is the defining characteristic of most industrial businesses. Revenue correlates with economic cycles, and margins compress in downturns as fixed costs are spread across lower volumes. Your model must stress test downturn scenarios—what happens if revenue declines 20% while maintaining fixed costs? Can the company service its debt through a cycle?

**Capacity and capital expenditure** require careful modeling. Manufacturing businesses require significant maintenance capex to sustain operations, plus growth capex to expand capacity. Distinguish between these in your projections. A company might generate $50 million of EBITDA but require $20 million of maintenance capex, yielding only $30 million of sustainable free cash flow.

**Working capital intensity** is typically higher in industrial businesses. Inventory cycles can extend for months, and receivables collection from industrial customers takes time. Your model should reflect realistic working capital assumptions—a company with 90-day inventory, 60-day receivables, and 45-day payables has meaningful working capital requirements as revenue grows.

**Commodity and input cost exposure** creates margin volatility. If raw materials represent 40% of revenue and prices spike, can the company pass through costs to customers? Contracts with price adjustment clauses, hedging programs, and competitive position all affect margin stability.

**Aftermarket and service revenue** often commands higher margins and provides recurring income. A compressor manufacturer might sell equipment at modest margins but generate high-margin service revenue over decades of asset life. Value these revenue streams differently in your model.

### Adjusting Your Modeling Approach

Different sectors require different modeling emphases:

| Element | Software | Healthcare | Industrial |
|---------|----------|------------|------------|
| Primary valuation metric | ARR multiple | EBITDA multiple | EBITDA multiple |
| Growth driver | Net revenue retention | Same-store + new units | Volume x price |
| Key margin lever | Operating leverage at scale | Utilization | Capacity utilization |
| Working capital | Negative (deferred revenue) | Moderate | High (inventory) |
| Capex intensity | Low | Moderate | High |
| Cyclicality | Low | Low | High |
| Key risk | Churn, competition | Reimbursement, regulation | Economic cycle, input costs |

Your LBO model should reflect these differences. Software deals might use minimal debt given growth reinvestment needs. Healthcare roll-ups might emphasize multiple arbitrage through add-ons. Industrial deals might require cash flow sweeps to rapidly deleverage before the next downturn.

### Demonstrating Sector Knowledge

In interviews, sector-specific knowledge differentiates candidates. Rather than generic LBO mechanics, discuss how sector dynamics affect deal structuring, value creation, and risk assessment.

If discussing a software investment, explain why you would model net revenue retention scenarios and how ARR growth affects exit multiples. For healthcare, articulate reimbursement risk and how you would diligence payer mix. For industrials, demonstrate cycle awareness and explain how you would stress test downturn scenarios.

This sector fluency signals that you can contribute meaningfully from day one, engaging substantively with deal teams and portfolio companies.

## Key Takeaways

- Software businesses require focus on recurring revenue metrics (ARR, NRR), customer acquisition economics, and deferred revenue working capital benefits
- Healthcare modeling must capture reimbursement dynamics, payer mix sensitivity, capacity utilization, and same-store versus new-unit growth
- Industrial businesses demand cycle-aware stress testing, careful capex treatment, working capital intensity assumptions, and commodity exposure analysis
- Different sectors warrant different valuation approaches, leverage levels, and value creation strategies—one-size-fits-all LBO modeling misses critical dynamics
- Demonstrating sector-specific knowledge in interviews signals readiness to contribute substantively to deal teams focused on particular industries
