## Written Guide

### The Value Creation Power of Add-ons

Buy-and-build strategies have become central to private equity value creation. Rather than simply improving a single company's operations, sponsors acquire a "platform" and then make smaller "add-on" acquisitions to build scale, expand capabilities, and achieve consolidation economics. Understanding how to model add-ons—and how they transform returns—is essential knowledge.

When a partner tells you to "add the tuck-in to the model and show me how it affects returns," you need to execute precisely and explain the drivers clearly.

### The Platform and Add-on Framework

The strategy begins with a platform acquisition: a company with strong management, scalable infrastructure, and positioning in a fragmented market. The platform might have $50 million of EBITDA and trade at 10x, but smaller competitors with $5-15 million of EBITDA might transact at 6-7x because they lack scale, management depth, or buyer interest.

The arbitrage is straightforward. If the platform acquires a $10 million EBITDA company at 6x ($60 million), the combined $60 million EBITDA entity is worth $600 million at the platform's 10x multiple—even with zero synergies. The add-on's multiple effectively expands from 6x to 10x simply by being part of the larger platform.

This multiple arbitrage is compelling, but modeling it correctly requires careful treatment of timing, financing, and synergies.

### Modeling Add-on Acquisitions

Your LBO model must accommodate add-on transactions at specified future dates. The key mechanics:

**Sources and uses for the add-on**: Just like the initial acquisition, each add-on has its own sources and uses. The sources might include incremental debt from the DDTL, cash from the platform's balance sheet, and potentially additional sponsor equity.

**Impact on the balance sheet**: The add-on's assets, liabilities, and goodwill layer onto the platform's balance sheet. Enterprise value increases by the purchase price; net debt increases by any debt incurred to fund the transaction.

**Income statement integration**: The add-on contributes revenue and EBITDA from the acquisition date forward. If you acquire a company mid-year, your model should reflect partial-year contribution in Year 1, full-year in subsequent years.

**Pro forma adjustments**: Add-ons often require working capital adjustments, transaction cost treatment, and alignment of accounting policies. These adjustments ensure the combined financials are appropriately stated.

Consider a platform purchased for $500 million with $50 million EBITDA (10x). In Year 2, you acquire an add-on with $10 million EBITDA for $65 million (6.5x), funded with $50 million of incremental debt and $15 million from platform cash. Post-acquisition, consolidated EBITDA is $60 million, and net debt increases by $50 million. The enterprise value increases by more than the purchase price if the combined multiple expands.

### Synergy Modeling

Synergies create additional value beyond the sum of standalone businesses. Your model should capture both cost and revenue synergies.

**Cost synergies** come from eliminating redundant functions, leveraging purchasing power, and consolidating facilities. Typical sources include corporate overhead reduction (one CFO, not two), procurement savings (volume discounts), and operational consolidation. Cost synergies are more certain and typically realize within 12-24 months.

**Revenue synergies** arise from cross-selling, geographic expansion, or capability combination. These are harder to achieve and take longer to realize. Model them conservatively and with appropriate delay.

**Integration costs** must offset synergy benefits. Achieving $5 million of annual cost synergies might require $10 million of one-time integration spending for severance, systems conversion, and facility consolidation. Your model should capture both the costs and the timing of synergy realization.

Continuing the example: if the add-on generates $3 million of annual cost synergies (15% synergy capture on $20 million of combined overhead), consolidated EBITDA becomes $63 million by Year 3. At a 10x exit multiple, that is $630 million of enterprise value versus $600 million without synergies—a $30 million value uplift against $3 million of ongoing synergy benefit.

### Roll-up Economics and Returns Impact

Roll-up strategies involve multiple add-ons over the hold period. The compounding effect can dramatically enhance returns, but execution risk also compounds.

Model a hypothetical roll-up:

- **Year 0**: Acquire platform at $500 million (10x on $50 million EBITDA)
- **Year 1**: Add-on A at $40 million (6x on $6.7 million EBITDA), $2 million synergies
- **Year 2**: Add-on B at $55 million (6.5x on $8.5 million EBITDA), $2.5 million synergies
- **Year 3**: Add-on C at $30 million (5x on $6 million EBITDA), $1.5 million synergies
- **Year 5 exit**: Combined platform with $80 million EBITDA exits at 10x

Total invested capital: $500 million platform plus $125 million in add-ons, less whatever was debt-financed. If $100 million of add-ons were funded with incremental debt, equity invested is $525 million. Exit enterprise value of $800 million, less net debt, yields equity proceeds. The IRR benefits from both EBITDA growth and the effective multiple expansion as add-ons roll into the platform valuation.

### Execution Considerations

Roll-ups carry meaningful execution risk. Management bandwidth is consumed by integration rather than organic growth. Culture clashes can destroy value. Integration costs sometimes exceed projections, and synergies sometimes disappoint.

Your model should stress test these risks:

- **Synergy haircut scenarios**: What if only 50% of projected synergies materialize?
- **Integration delays**: What if Year 2 add-on synergies take until Year 4 to fully realize?
- **Execution failure**: What if one add-on actively destroys value and requires remediation?

In interviews, acknowledge both the power and the risks of roll-up strategies. Sophisticated sponsors know that buy-and-build requires exceptional management teams and focused integration capabilities.

### Financing Add-on Acquisitions

Add-ons can be financed through several mechanisms:

**Delayed draw term loans (DDTLs)**: Pre-committed capacity specifically for acquisitions, typically at terms similar to the initial facility.

**Incremental facilities**: Additional debt raised after closing, subject to incremental leverage and other covenant tests in the existing credit agreement.

**Platform cash flow**: Free cash flow generated by the platform can fund smaller add-ons without additional leverage.

**Seller notes and earnouts**: Deferring purchase consideration reduces upfront funding requirements.

**Additional sponsor equity**: For larger add-ons, sponsors may contribute incremental equity, though this dilutes fund returns.

Your model must reflect the financing mix for each add-on and its impact on consolidated leverage, interest expense, and covenant compliance.

## Key Takeaways

- Add-on acquisitions create value through multiple arbitrage, synergies, and scale benefits, potentially transforming platform returns
- Model add-ons with full sources and uses, partial-period contributions, and explicit synergy timing and integration costs
- Synergies should be modeled conservatively—cost synergies are more reliable than revenue synergies, and integration costs must be captured
- Roll-up strategies compound value creation but also compound execution risk; stress test integration delays and synergy shortfalls
- Financing add-ons through DDTLs, incremental facilities, or platform cash flow affects leverage and returns differently—model each source appropriately
