# Comparable Transactions and Valuation in Cases

## Learning Objectives

- Use comparable transactions to assess whether the entry valuation is reasonable
- Understand when and how to reference comps and precedent transactions in case studies
- Evaluate how valuation context informs the investment decision
- Defend valuation assumptions by referencing market benchmarks

## Written Guide

### Why Valuation Matters in Cases

In a case study, you're often given a purchase price or valuation multiple. You must assess: **Is this price reasonable?** Comparable transactions and trading comps provide context.

If the price is too high relative to comps, returns will be compressed. If it's reasonable or low, returns may be attractive.

### Using Comparable Transactions

**Precedent PE transactions** show what other sponsors have paid for similar companies. If recent comps are trading at 9-11× EBITDA, an entry multiple of 10× is in line with market. An entry multiple of 13× is aggressive.

**Key considerations**:
- **Recency**: Use transactions from the last 12-24 months. Older deals may not reflect current market conditions.
- **Comparability**: Look for similar industries, sizes, growth profiles, and geographies.
- **Deal structure**: All-cash vs. stock, strategic vs. sponsor buyers.

If comps paid 8-10× and you're evaluating a deal at 12×, you must justify why this company deserves a premium (higher growth, better margins, stronger position).

### Using Trading Comps

**Public trading multiples** (EV/EBITDA, EV/Revenue) show what the public market values similar companies at. Trading comps reflect minority stakes, so they're typically lower than control premiums paid in M&A.

Adjust for control premium (typically 20-30%) when comparing to LBO entry multiples.

**Example**:
- Trading comps: 8-10× EBITDA
- Control premium: 25%
- Implied LBO entry range: 10-12.5× EBITDA

If the deal is at 11×, it's in line. If it's at 14×, it's expensive.

### How to Present Valuation Analysis

In a case presentation:

1. **State the entry valuation**: "The proposed purchase price is $1B, or 10.0× LTM EBITDA."

2. **Reference comps**: "Recent sponsor-backed transactions in this sector have traded at 9-11× EBITDA, so the entry multiple is in line with market."

3. **Assess reasonableness**: "Given the company's strong growth and market position, I believe 10× is reasonable. However, if we can negotiate to 9.5×, returns would improve by 2-3 percentage points."

4. **Link to returns**: "At 10× entry and 9.5× exit, the deal generates a 2.7× MOIC. If we overpay at 11× entry, MOIC drops to 2.4×."

### When to Negotiate or Pass

**Negotiate if**:
- Entry multiple is at the high end of comps
- Downside returns are below acceptable hurdles (e.g., <15% IRR)
- Risks are elevated

**Pass if**:
- Entry multiple is materially above comps with no justification
- Returns are weak even in base case
- Risks are unmitigable

**Invest if**:
- Entry multiple is in line with or below comps
- Returns are attractive (25%+ IRR) with downside protection (>15% IRR in downside)
- Risks are manageable

### Common Mistakes

**Not referencing comps at all**: Saying "10× seems reasonable" without market context is weak.

**Using outdated comps**: Citing transactions from 3 years ago when the market has changed.

**Ignoring company-specific factors**: If the company is higher quality or faster growing than comps, a premium may be justified.

**Not linking valuation to returns**: Discussing whether the multiple is high or low without explaining how it affects IRR.

## Key Takeaways

- Use comparable transactions to assess whether the entry valuation is reasonable
- Recent sponsor-backed transactions (9-11× EBITDA) provide benchmark for entry multiples
- Trading comps are lower (minority stakes); adjust for 20-30% control premium when comparing to LBO entry
- Present valuation by stating entry multiple, referencing comps, assessing reasonableness, and linking to returns
- Negotiate if entry is at high end of comps or downside returns are weak; pass if materially above comps with no justification
- Link valuation to returns: explain how entry multiple affects IRR and MOIC
