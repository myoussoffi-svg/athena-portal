# Defending Your Recommendation Under Pushback

## Learning Objectives

- Defend investment recommendations clearly and confidently when challenged
- Handle objections and alternative perspectives without being defensive
- Demonstrate intellectual flexibility by acknowledging valid counterarguments
- Explain when and how to adjust your recommendation based on new information

## Written Guide

### Why Interviewers Push Back

After presenting a case, interviewers will challenge your recommendation. They're testing:

**Depth of thinking**: Do you understand your analysis, or did you memorize a framework?

**Defensibility**: Can you articulate why your assumptions and conclusions are sound?

**Flexibility**: Can you adapt your thinking when presented with new information?

**Composure**: Do you stay calm and professional under pressure?

Pushback is not personal. It's part of the interview.

### Common Types of Pushback

**Challenging assumptions**:
- "Why did you assume 8% revenue growth? What if it's only 4%?"
- "Your margin expansion seems aggressive. What if margins stay flat?"

**Challenging the thesis**:
- "You say this is a margin expansion story, but I don't see a clear path. Can you elaborate?"
- "How confident are you that add-on acquisitions will work?"

**Introducing new information**:
- "What if I told you the top customer is considering switching to a competitor?"
- "What if the CEO is planning to retire in two years?"

**Testing downside**:
- "What happens if EBITDA declines 20% in Year 2?"
- "Could this company go bankrupt if markets turn?"

**Questioning valuation**:
- "Don't you think 10× EBITDA is expensive for this business?"
- "Why would a buyer pay this multiple at exit?"

### How to Respond to Challenges

**1. Stay calm and professional**: Don't get defensive or argumentative. Acknowledge the question thoughtfully.

**2. Acknowledge valid points**: "That's a good point. If revenue growth is only 4%, returns would be lower."

**3. Defend your rationale**: "I assumed 8% growth based on historical trends and industry projections, but I've sensitized this assumption. At 4% growth, IRR drops from 24% to 18%, which is still above our hurdle rate."

**4. Reference your analysis**: "I've modeled a downside scenario where margins stay flat instead of expanding. In that case, MOIC is 2.3× instead of 2.8×, which is still acceptable."

**5. Show flexibility**: "If the CEO is retiring, that's a risk I hadn't considered. I'd want to assess the depth of the management team and potentially bring in an experienced operator as part of the deal."

### Handling "What If" Scenarios

Interviewers often introduce hypothetical changes to test your thinking:

**"What if the top customer leaves?"**

"That would be a material risk. The top customer represents 25% of revenue, so losing them would reduce EBITDA by $25M, or about 25%. That would significantly hurt returns—IRR might drop from 24% to 12-15%. Given that risk, I'd either negotiate a lower purchase price to build in more margin of safety, or I'd want long-term contracts with the top customers as a condition of the deal."

**"What if EBITDA declines 20% in Year 2?"**

"A 20% EBITDA decline would be severe. The company would still generate cash, but debt paydown would slow, and remaining debt at exit would be higher. Exit equity value would be lower due to both lower EBITDA and higher remaining debt. IRR would likely drop below 10%, which would not meet our return threshold. In that scenario, I'd consider whether the business is fundamentally broken or if it's a temporary issue that can be fixed."

### When to Adjust Your Recommendation

If the interviewer introduces **material new information** that undermines your thesis, acknowledge it and adjust:

**Example**:

**Interviewer**: "What if I told you that a major competitor just announced a price cut of 30%?"

**Candidate**: "That's a significant risk that would materially affect the company's margins and market share. If competitors are cutting prices 30%, this company would face pressure to follow, which would compress margins and reduce EBITDA. Given that, I'd need to reassess the investment. I might pass unless we can negotiate a materially lower purchase price to reflect this new competitive dynamic. Alternatively, I'd want to understand whether this company has differentiation or switching costs that protect it from price competition."

This shows intellectual flexibility and sound judgment.

### When to Hold Your Ground

If the interviewer is testing your conviction but your analysis is sound, defend it:

**Interviewer**: "I think 10× EBITDA is too expensive."

**Candidate**: "I understand that concern. 10× is at the higher end of recent comps, but I believe it's justified given the company's 15% revenue growth, 30% EBITDA margins, and strong competitive position. Comps with similar growth profiles have traded at 10-12×. That said, if we can negotiate to 9.5×, returns would improve, and I'd be more comfortable. But at 10×, I still think the deal works."

### Common Mistakes

**Being defensive or argumentative**: "No, you're wrong—my analysis is correct" will get you dinged.

**Ignoring the challenge**: Brushing off a valid concern without addressing it.

**Changing your recommendation too quickly**: If the interviewer introduces a minor issue, don't immediately flip from "invest" to "pass." Assess materiality.

**Not referencing your analysis**: Saying "I think it's fine" without pointing to sensitivities or downside scenarios.
