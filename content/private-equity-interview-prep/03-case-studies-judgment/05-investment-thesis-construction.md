# Investment Thesis Construction

## Learning Objectives

- Construct a clear, compelling investment thesis that synthesizes analysis into a coherent narrative
- Identify value creation opportunities and how they translate to returns
- Structure the thesis to emphasize the most important drivers
- Defend the thesis under challenge by connecting it to analysis

## Written Guide

### What Is an Investment Thesis?

An **investment thesis** is a concise explanation of why a particular investment will generate attractive returns. It synthesizes industry analysis, company quality, financial projections, and value creation opportunities into a coherent narrative.

A strong thesis answers: **Why is this an attractive investment at this price?**

### Components of a Strong Thesis

**1. Company Overview and Positioning**:
- What does the company do?
- What makes it attractive? (market leader, strong moat, favorable industry)

**2. Investment Rationale (3-4 key points)**:
- Why will this generate returns?
- Value creation opportunities
- Competitive advantages

**3. Value Creation Plan**:
- How will the PE firm improve the business?
- Operational improvements, add-on acquisitions, strategic initiatives

**4. Return Drivers**:
- What drives returns? (EBITDA growth, debt paydown, multiple expansion)
- Quantify expected returns (MOIC, IRR)

**5. Exit Path**:
- How and when will the investment exit?
- Strategic sale, sponsor sale, IPO

### Example Investment Thesis

"We recommend investing in ABC Manufacturing at 9.5× EBITDA. The company is the #2 player in a fragmented, growing industrial market and has strong customer relationships and recurring revenue. The investment thesis rests on three pillars:

1. **Margin expansion**: Through operational improvements and procurement optimization, we can expand EBITDA margins from 18% to 21% over five years, adding $30M in EBITDA.

2. **Add-on acquisitions**: The market is fragmented with 50+ small competitors. We can execute 2-3 add-ons to consolidate share, achieve cost synergies, and expand geographically.

3. **Organic growth**: The end markets are growing 4-5% annually, and the company has historically gained share. We underwrite 6% revenue growth.

These drivers support exit EBITDA of $140M (vs. $100M today). At a 9.0× exit multiple, this generates a 2.8× MOIC and 23% IRR over five years. The investment is defensible even in downside scenarios."

### How to Structure the Thesis

**Lead with the most important driver**: If margin expansion is the key value creation lever, start there. If it's add-on acquisitions, lead with that.

**Be specific**: Don't say "grow revenue and improve margins." Say "expand EBITDA margins from 18% to 21% through procurement optimization and operational efficiency, and grow revenue 6% annually through market share gains."

**Quantify impact**: Show how each driver contributes to EBITDA growth or returns.

**Connect to returns**: Explain how the thesis translates to attractive IRR/MOIC.

### Value Creation Levers

Common PE value creation strategies:

**Operational improvements**: Cost reduction, margin expansion, efficiency gains, working capital optimization

**Revenue growth**: Market share gains, new products, geographic expansion, pricing optimization

**Add-on acquisitions**: Consolidation, bolt-ons, vertical integration

**Strategic repositioning**: Exiting underperforming segments, focusing on high-margin products, changing business model

**Management upgrades**: Bringing in experienced executives, aligning incentives with equity

Focus on 2-3 levers. Don't claim you'll do everything.

### Common Mistakes

**Vague thesis**: "This is a good company in a good industry" is not a thesis. Be specific about what drives returns.

**Overreliance on market growth**: "The market is growing 10%" is not enough. How will the company capture that growth?

**Unrealistic assumptions**: Claiming 500 bps margin expansion and 5 add-ons in 3 years is aggressive unless well-justified.

**No connection to returns**: Explaining value creation without showing how it translates to IRR/MOIC.

**Ignoring risks**: A thesis that doesn't acknowledge key risks seems naive.
