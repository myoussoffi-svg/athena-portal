# Risk Identification and Downside Analysis

## Learning Objectives

- Identify and categorize key investment risks systematically
- Construct downside scenarios and assess their impact on returns
- Explain risk mitigation strategies and monitoring approaches
- Demonstrate balanced thinking by addressing risks alongside upside

## Written Guide

### Why Risk Analysis Matters

PE investors are paid to take risk, but they must understand and manage it. In case studies, interviewers assess whether you can identify what could go wrong and how it affects returns. Presenting only upside without acknowledging downside signals naive thinking.

### Categories of Investment Risk

**Operational Risks**: Execution failures, operational inefficiencies, integration challenges (for add-ons), management turnover, product quality issues

**Market Risks**: Industry decline, demand shock, competitive intensity, pricing pressure, market share loss

**Financial Risks**: Inability to service debt, cash flow shortfall, working capital drain, covenant violations

**Regulatory/Legal Risks**: Regulatory changes, compliance failures, litigation, environmental liabilities

**Strategic Risks**: Failed product launches, M&A integration issues, technology disruption, loss of key customers

**Exit Risks**: Multiple compression, inability to find buyer, market downturn affecting exit timing

### How to Identify Risks

**Review financials for trends**: Declining margins, volatile revenue, deteriorating cash conversion

**Assess competitive position**: New entrants, substitute products, customer/supplier concentration

**Consider industry dynamics**: Cyclicality, regulation, technology disruption

**Evaluate management**: Track record of execution, depth of team

**Ask "what if" questions**: What if the top customer leaves? What if a competitor cuts prices? What if EBITDA declines 20%?

### Downside Scenarios

Construct a downside case to test investment resilience:

**Base case**: Reasonable assumptions (6% growth, 100 bps margin expansion)

**Downside case**: Conservative assumptions (2% growth, flat margins, multiple compression)

Calculate returns in downside: If IRR drops from 25% to 12%, is that acceptable? If MOIC drops below 2.0×, the deal may not be attractive.

**Stress test**: What if EBITDA declines 10-20%? Can the company still service debt? This tests for default risk.

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

For each major risk, propose mitigants:

**Operational risk**: Bring in experienced management, invest in systems, implement KPIs and monitoring

**Market risk**: Diversify customer base, expand geographically, develop new products

**Financial risk**: Use conservative leverage, maintain liquidity cushion, negotiate flexible covenants

**Competitive risk**: Invest in R&D, build brand, create switching costs

**Exit risk**: Identify multiple exit paths (strategic, sponsor, IPO), be patient on timing

### How to Present Risks

In a case study presentation:

1. **Identify 3-5 key risks** (don't list 20; focus on what matters most)
2. **Explain impact**: How does each risk affect EBITDA, cash flow, or exit valuation?
3. **Propose mitigants**: What can be done to address or monitor the risk?
4. **Quantify downside**: Show returns under downside case

**Example**:

"The biggest risk is customer concentration—the top 3 customers represent 40% of revenue. If we lose one, EBITDA could decline 15%, which would reduce IRR from 24% to 16%. We can mitigate this by diversifying the customer base through new customer acquisition and expanding into adjacent markets. We'd also structure long-term contracts with key customers to reduce churn risk."

### Common Mistakes

**Ignoring risks entirely**: Presenting only upside without acknowledging downside

**Listing risks without impact assessment**: Saying "customer concentration is a risk" without explaining consequences

**No mitigants**: Identifying risks but not proposing how to address them

**Overly pessimistic**: Being so risk-focused that you talk yourself out of good investments
