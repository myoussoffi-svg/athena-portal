## Written Guide

### What Is Company Quality?

High-quality companies have durable competitive advantages (moats), predictable recurring revenue, strong margins and cash generation, and experienced management. Low-quality companies are fragile, commoditized, or dependent on unsustainable advantages.

### Key Dimensions of Quality

**Business Model**: How does the company make money? Recurring revenue (subscriptions, contracts) is better than transactional. High gross margins (60%+) suggest pricing power; low margins (<20%) suggest commoditization.

**Competitive Position**: Market share, differentiation, switching costs. Is the company #1, #2, or a distant follower? What makes it different from competitors?

**Financial Performance**: Consistent revenue growth, margin trends (expanding, stable, or declining), cash generation. Does EBITDA convert to cash, or is it trapped in working capital or CapEx?

**Customer Concentration**: Is revenue diversified or dependent on a few large customers? High concentration (top 3 customers = 50%+ revenue) is risky.

**Management Team**: Track record of growth and execution. Depth beyond the CEO.

### Red Flags

**Financial**: Declining revenue or margins, negative cash flow despite positive EBITDA, high CapEx or working capital requirements

**Operational**: High customer churn, reliance on single product/customer/supplier, recent management turnover

**Market**: Secular industry decline, intense competition, regulatory or technology disruption

### Diligence Priorities

**High priority**: Revenue sustainability, margin sustainability, customer concentration, competitive threats

**Medium priority**: Management quality (unless red flag), CapEx trends, supplier relationships

**Low priority**: Minor operational inefficiencies, small product lines

Focus on what could break the investment thesis.

### How Quality Informs Valuation

High-quality companies: Higher entry and exit multiples, can use aggressive assumptions, lower risk

Low-quality companies: Require lower multiples (margin of safety), conservative assumptions, focus on downside
