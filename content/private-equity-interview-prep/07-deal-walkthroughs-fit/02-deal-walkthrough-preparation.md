# Preparing Your Deal Walkthrough - Structure and Content

Effective deal walkthrough preparation requires systematic effort across multiple dimensions. You need to select the right deals, master the relevant details, develop a clear narrative structure, and anticipate the follow-up questions that will test the depth of your knowledge. This lesson provides the comprehensive preparation framework that will enable you to deliver compelling deal walkthroughs.

## Selecting Your Deals

You should prepare two to three deals in depth. Having multiple prepared deals allows you to select the most appropriate transaction based on the interviewer's background and the firm's investment focus. A growth equity firm partner will engage differently with a leveraged buyout than with a strategic acquisition, so having range gives you flexibility.

When selecting deals, prioritize transactions where you had meaningful analytical involvement. A smaller deal where you built the model and drove the valuation analysis is far more valuable than a mega-deal where you were one of many analysts formatting pitch books. Interviewers can immediately sense the difference between genuine involvement and peripheral participation.

Also consider deal relevance to private equity. LBO advisory assignments are ideal because they directly mirror PE work. M&A transactions provide strong material because they involve valuation and strategic analysis. Financing transactions can work if you can demonstrate analytical depth around credit metrics and capital structure. Pure execution work like IPOs or follow-on offerings requires more effort to frame in PE-relevant terms.

## The Core Elements You Must Know

For each deal you prepare, you must achieve mastery across several dimensions. Surface-level familiarity will not survive serious follow-up questioning.

**Transaction Overview**: Know the precise deal size, the parties involved, the transaction structure, and the timeline. Be able to state these facts immediately without hesitation. Fumbling on basic deal parameters signals weak preparation.

**Strategic Rationale**: Understand why the transaction happened. What was the seller's motivation? What was the buyer's strategic thesis? How did this deal fit into broader industry dynamics? You should be able to articulate the logic driving the transaction from multiple perspectives.

**Valuation Details**: This is where interviewers probe most aggressively. Know which methodologies you used and why. Understand the key assumptions in your DCF, the selection criteria for your comps, and the rationale for precedent transaction selection. Be prepared to discuss the implied multiples and how they compared to market benchmarks. Know why the final price was determined and what factors drove the negotiation.

**Financial Profile**: Memorize the target's key financial metrics. What was revenue? EBITDA? Growth rates? Margins? How did these metrics compare to peers? What was the trajectory over the historical period and projections? This financial fluency demonstrates genuine engagement with the analysis.

**Your Specific Contributions**: Be precise about what you actually did versus what the team did. Did you build the model from scratch or update an existing template? Did you conduct the valuation analysis or compile others' work? Did you attend management presentations or work exclusively on documents? Overstating your role is a critical mistake that experienced interviewers will quickly expose.

**Deal Outcome and Learnings**: Know how the deal concluded. Did it close at the announced terms? Were there complications? What did you learn from the experience? What would you do differently with hindsight?

## The Optimal Narrative Structure

Your initial walkthrough should take approximately two minutes. This is long enough to demonstrate substance but short enough to maintain engagement and leave room for dialogue. Use the following structure as your foundation.

**Opening Context (15-20 seconds)**: Provide immediate orientation. State the transaction type, the parties, the deal size, and your role. For example: "I worked on a sell-side M&A advisory for a healthcare services company, advising on their $400 million sale to a private equity sponsor. I was one of two analysts on the deal team and was responsible for the valuation analysis and management presentation materials."

**Strategic Rationale (20-25 seconds)**: Explain why the deal happened. Describe the seller's objectives and the buyer's investment thesis. Connect the transaction to industry dynamics where relevant. This demonstrates that you understood the deal beyond the mechanics.

**Valuation Discussion (30-40 seconds)**: Walk through your valuation approach, the key outputs, and how the final price was determined. Highlight the methodologies you used, the ranges you derived, and the factors that influenced pricing. This is your opportunity to demonstrate technical depth.

**Financing and Structure (20-25 seconds)**: For leveraged transactions, discuss the capital structure. Describe the debt package, the equity contribution, and how the financing was arranged. For strategic deals, discuss the consideration structure and any earnouts or contingent elements.

**Your Role and Contributions (20-25 seconds)**: Clearly articulate what you did. Specific is always better than general. Saying "I built the operating model and ran over thirty sensitivity scenarios to stress-test the thesis" is far more compelling than "I supported the valuation work."

**Closing and Outcome (15-20 seconds)**: Conclude with the deal result and a brief reflection on what you learned or found most interesting about the transaction. This creates a natural transition to follow-up discussion.

## Preparing for Follow-Up Questions

The initial walkthrough is just the beginning. Interviewers will drill into specific aspects of your deal, testing the depth of your knowledge and the quality of your judgment.

**Valuation Deep Dives**: Be prepared to walk through your DCF step by step, explain your WACC calculation, justify your terminal value assumptions, and discuss how you selected comparable companies. Know the key sensitivities and what drove valuation differences across methodologies.

**Deal Dynamics Questions**: Why did the seller choose this buyer? Were there other bidders? What were the key negotiation points? How did due diligence findings impact the transaction?

**Critical Evaluation Questions**: Was this a good deal for the buyer? Would you have invested? What were the main risks? These questions test your investor mindset and ability to evaluate transactions objectively.

**Technical Stress Tests**: Interviewers may challenge your assumptions directly. If you assumed 5% revenue growth, they might ask why not 3% or 7%. If you used a certain WACC, they might question your beta or equity risk premium. Prepare to defend your analytical choices.

Practice your deal walkthrough multiple times, ideally with someone who can ask challenging follow-up questions. The goal is not memorization but internalization. You should know your deals so well that you can discuss any aspect naturally and confidently, adapting to whatever direction the interviewer takes the conversation.
