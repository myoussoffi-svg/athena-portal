# Discussing PE Deals and Transactions You Follow

Beyond discussing your own banking deals, PE interviewers frequently ask about private equity transactions you have followed in the news. This question tests your genuine interest in the industry, your analytical instincts when evaluating investments, and your ability to form and articulate investment opinions. Candidates who can discuss current PE activity thoughtfully demonstrate that they actively engage with the industry rather than passively pursuing interview opportunities.

## Why Interviewers Ask About External Deals

When interviewers ask "What PE deals have you been following?" or "Tell me about a recent PE transaction that interested you," they are evaluating multiple dimensions of your candidacy.

First, they are testing genuine industry interest. Candidates who actively follow PE deal activity demonstrate authentic engagement with the industry. Reading about PE transactions in your spare time suggests you will be genuinely curious and motivated in the role.

Second, they are assessing your analytical instincts. How you discuss an external deal reveals how you think about investments. Do you focus on the investment thesis, or do you get lost in surface-level details? Do you consider both the opportunity and the risks? Do you evaluate whether the price seems reasonable? Your analytical approach to external deals previews how you would analyze investments on the job.

Third, they are evaluating your communication skills. Explaining a complex transaction you did not work on requires synthesis and clarity. You must distill extensive information into a coherent narrative that demonstrates your understanding.

## Selecting Deals to Discuss

Choose deals strategically based on several criteria. First, select transactions you genuinely find interesting. Authentic enthusiasm is difficult to fake and easy to detect. If you followed a deal because the investment thesis fascinated you, that interest will come through naturally.

Second, choose deals with enough public information available. You need sufficient detail to discuss the investment rationale, the valuation context, and the strategic logic. Deals with significant press coverage, investor presentations, or analyst commentary provide richer material.

Third, consider relevance to the firm you are interviewing with. If the firm focuses on healthcare, discussing a recent healthcare PE transaction demonstrates sector interest. If they do middle-market deals, discussing a mega-cap transaction may be less relevant than a middle-market example.

Fourth, select deals where you can articulate a perspective. The most compelling answers include your own view on whether the deal makes sense. Choose transactions where you have developed genuine opinions about the investment thesis.

## Framework for Discussing PE Transactions

When discussing PE deals, structure your response to demonstrate analytical thinking and investment judgment.

**Transaction Overview**: Begin with clear context. Identify the buyer, the target, the deal size, and when it was announced or closed. Provide enough background that someone unfamiliar with the deal can follow your discussion.

**Investment Thesis**: Explain why the PE firm pursued this investment. What is the value creation opportunity? Is it operational improvement, multiple expansion, revenue growth, add-on acquisitions, or some combination? Articulate the thesis in investor terms.

**Valuation Context**: Discuss what you know about the valuation. What multiple was paid? How does this compare to public market benchmarks or other recent transactions? Does the price seem reasonable given the investment thesis?

**Key Risks and Considerations**: Demonstrate critical thinking by discussing what could go wrong. What are the main risks to the investment thesis? What would concern you if you were evaluating this deal?

**Your Perspective**: Conclude with your view. Does the investment thesis seem compelling? Would you be excited about this deal if you were at the firm? What would you want to understand better if you were doing diligence?

## Example Deal Discussion

"I have been following the take-private of Coupa Software by Thoma Bravo for $8 billion. This deal interests me because it illustrates the software PE playbook I find compelling.

Coupa is a spend management platform with strong recurring revenue and a large customer base, but the company was trading at depressed multiples compared to its historical range due to broader technology valuation compression. Thoma Bravo paid around 7.5 times revenue, which was a significant premium to the pre-announcement trading price but well below where Coupa traded during the 2021 peak.

The investment thesis appears to focus on margin expansion and continued growth. Coupa has strong gross margins but had been investing heavily in R&D and sales, which compressed profitability. As a private company, Thoma Bravo can optimize the cost structure without quarterly earnings pressure while continuing to grow the platform through product expansion and cross-sell.

The key risks I would consider are competitive dynamics, since spend management is increasingly competitive, and the integration challenges that come with platform consolidation. Additionally, the debt markets were challenging when this deal was announced, so the financing structure would be important to understand.

Overall, I find the thesis compelling because Coupa has durable competitive advantages in a growing market, and the valuation entry point seems reasonable relative to historical levels. If I were evaluating this deal, I would want to dig into customer retention metrics, competitive win rates, and the detailed margin expansion roadmap."

## Staying Current on PE Activity

Developing a regular practice for following PE deals will ensure you always have recent examples to discuss. Review publications like the Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, and Bloomberg for deal announcements. PE-focused sources like Pitchbook, Buyouts, and PE Hub provide industry-specific coverage. Set up news alerts for major PE firms and sectors that interest you.

When you encounter an interesting deal, spend fifteen minutes researching it further. Read the press release, review available materials, and think through the investment thesis. Building this habit will ensure you have multiple well-researched examples ready for any interview.

Avoid discussing deals superficially. If you mention a transaction, be prepared to discuss it in depth. Interviewers will probe your knowledge, and revealing that you only know surface-level details undermines your credibility. It is better to discuss one or two deals thoroughly than to mention several you cannot explain in detail.
