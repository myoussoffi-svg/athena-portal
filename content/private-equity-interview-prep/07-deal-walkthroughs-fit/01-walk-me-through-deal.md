# "Walk Me Through a Deal" - The Defining PE Interview Question

There is no question more certain in private equity interviews than "walk me through a deal you worked on." Every firm asks it. Every interviewer expects you to nail it. And yet, most candidates underperform on this seemingly straightforward question because they fail to understand what interviewers are actually evaluating.

When a PE professional asks you to walk through a deal, they are conducting a multi-dimensional assessment in real time. They are testing your technical depth, evaluating your communication skills, gauging your involvement level, and most importantly, determining whether you think like an investor. The deal walkthrough is not a recitation exercise; it is a window into how your mind works and whether you would add value to their team from day one.

## What Interviewers Are Really Evaluating

The surface-level purpose of the deal walkthrough is obvious: they want to understand your experience. But beneath this lies a sophisticated evaluation framework that most candidates never recognize.

**Technical Competence**: Can you discuss valuation methodologies with precision? Do you understand how financing structures work? When pressed on model assumptions, can you defend your choices intelligently? Interviewers are listening for evidence that you truly understand the mechanics of dealmaking, not just that you participated in deals.

**Depth of Involvement**: There is a profound difference between an analyst who built the model and ran the analysis versus one who simply formatted slides and compiled data rooms. Your walkthrough reveals which category you fall into. PE firms want candidates who were genuinely involved in the analytical and strategic aspects of their transactions.

**Communication and Judgment**: Can you distill a complex six-month transaction into a clear, structured narrative? Do you know what details matter and what to omit? The ability to communicate efficiently about deals is essential in PE, where you will present to investment committees, brief partners, and explain transactions to portfolio company executives.

**Investor Mindset**: This is the most critical and most overlooked dimension. PE interviewers want to know whether you evaluated the deal from an investor's perspective. Did you consider whether the price was justified? Did you think about downside risks? Would you have invested your own money? Candidates who can shift from advisor to investor perspective immediately stand out.

## The Stakes Are Higher Than You Think

Many candidates treat the deal walkthrough as a warm-up question before the "real" technical interview begins. This is a serious mistake. Your deal walkthrough often determines the trajectory of the entire interview. A strong walkthrough builds credibility that carries through subsequent questions. A weak walkthrough creates doubt that is difficult to overcome, no matter how well you perform on LBO modeling questions.

Moreover, senior interviewers frequently use your deal walkthrough as the foundation for the rest of the conversation. They will drill into specific aspects of your transaction, test your technical knowledge through deal-specific questions, and evaluate your judgment by challenging your assumptions. If you cannot discuss your own deals with authority, how can they trust you to analyze their potential investments?

## Why Banking Analysts Often Struggle

Despite having worked on real transactions, many banking analysts deliver underwhelming deal walkthroughs. The primary reasons are predictable and avoidable.

First, analysts often know their deals superficially. They remember what they did but not why decisions were made. They recall building the model but cannot explain the key value drivers. This surface-level knowledge crumbles under follow-up questioning.

Second, analysts frequently fail to translate their banking experience into investor-relevant terms. Describing how you managed the data room or coordinated with lawyers does not demonstrate PE-relevant skills. Interviewers want to hear about valuation analysis, investment thesis development, and strategic rationale.

Third, many analysts have not reflected on their deals critically. They accepted the transaction dynamics as given without questioning whether the deal made sense, whether the price was appropriate, or what risks concerned them. PE professionals constantly evaluate deals from a critical investor perspective, and they expect candidates to demonstrate the same orientation.

## Setting Yourself Up for Success

The deal walkthrough is not something you can wing. Successful candidates invest significant time preparing their deal narratives, anticipating follow-up questions, and practicing delivery. They select deals strategically, choosing transactions that showcase relevant skills and provide rich material for discussion.

In the lessons that follow, we will cover exactly how to prepare your deal walkthroughs, including the optimal structure, what details to include, how to handle various deal types, and how to field the inevitable follow-up questions. You will learn to present your banking experience in terms that resonate with PE investors and demonstrate the judgment and technical depth that top firms seek.

The deal walkthrough may seem like a simple request to discuss your experience, but it is in fact one of the most important evaluation tools in the PE interview process. Treat it with the seriousness it deserves, and you will distinguish yourself from the majority of candidates who fail to recognize its true significance.
