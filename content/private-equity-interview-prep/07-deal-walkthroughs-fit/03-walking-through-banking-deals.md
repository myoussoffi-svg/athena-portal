# Walking Through Banking Deals for PE Audiences

Banking analysts accumulate diverse deal experience, from M&A advisory to debt financings to restructurings. Each transaction type requires a different framing strategy when presented to PE interviewers. This lesson covers how to translate various banking experiences into narratives that resonate with private equity professionals and demonstrate the skills they value most.

## Framing M&A Advisory Deals

M&A advisory work translates most naturally to PE interviews because it involves the strategic and valuation analysis central to private equity investing. However, you must shift your framing from advisor to investor perspective.

When discussing sell-side mandates, emphasize your understanding of what made the company attractive to buyers. Discuss the investment thesis you developed to market the company, the key value drivers you highlighted, and how you positioned the company's growth potential. This directly mirrors how PE professionals evaluate potential acquisitions.

For buy-side advisory, focus on the due diligence and analytical rigor you applied. Discuss how you evaluated the target, what risks you identified, and how you assessed whether the proposed price was justified. Emphasize your role in testing assumptions and challenging the investment thesis. PE firms want analysts who approach deals skeptically and identify issues before investment committee.

Regardless of which side you advised, always be prepared to answer the critical question: "Would you have invested in this deal?" This requires you to evaluate the transaction from a principal's perspective. Consider the entry valuation, the growth trajectory, the competitive dynamics, and the potential return profile. Having a thoughtful answer to this question demonstrates the investor mindset PE firms seek.

## Presenting Financing and Capital Markets Experience

Debt financings and capital markets transactions require more deliberate translation to be PE-relevant. The key is connecting your experience to how PE firms think about financing their investments.

When discussing leveraged finance transactions, focus on the credit analysis and capital structure considerations. Explain how you evaluated the company's ability to service debt, what covenants were appropriate, and how the financing structure aligned with the company's cash flow profile. These are exactly the considerations PE firms weigh when financing acquisitions.

Highlight your understanding of lender perspectives and credit dynamics. Discuss how different tranches of debt were priced, what drove lender appetite or concerns, and how terms evolved during negotiation. This knowledge is valuable in PE, where professionals regularly structure and negotiate debt packages.

For equity capital markets experience, connect your work to PE exit dynamics. If you worked on IPOs, discuss how you thought about valuation and positioning. If you supported follow-on offerings, explain your analysis of market conditions and pricing dynamics. PE firms ultimately exit through sales or public offerings, so understanding these processes is directly relevant.

## Translating Restructuring Experience

Restructuring experience can be highly valuable for PE interviews, particularly for firms that invest in distressed situations or special situations. The key is demonstrating analytical rigor around downside scenarios and value preservation.

Discuss how you analyzed the company's liquidity position, evaluated various restructuring alternatives, and modeled recovery scenarios for different stakeholders. Emphasize your understanding of how capital structure complexity affects outcomes and how negotiations between creditor classes unfold.

Connect this experience to PE by highlighting the analytical discipline it developed. Restructuring work requires rigorous cash flow forecasting, detailed sensitivity analysis, and clear thinking about downside scenarios. These skills directly transfer to the risk assessment PE firms conduct during due diligence.

However, be thoughtful about how much time you spend on restructuring deals in interviews. For mainstream PE firms focused on growth or buyout strategies, extensive discussion of distressed situations may not resonate as strongly. Lead with your most PE-relevant experience and use restructuring deals as secondary examples that demonstrate analytical range.

## Example Walkthroughs by Transaction Type

**M&A Sell-Side Example**: "I worked on the sale of a specialty chemicals business to a strategic acquirer for $650 million. The company was a family-owned business with strong EBITDA margins but limited scale. My role focused on building the valuation analysis and preparing management for buyer presentations. We positioned the company's proprietary formulations and stable customer relationships as key value drivers. The valuation analysis suggested a range of 8-10x EBITDA based on trading comps and precedent transactions. The final sale price of 9.5x reflected a strategic premium given the buyer's synergy opportunities. I built the model, ran sensitivities on raw material costs and customer concentration, and supported due diligence coordination. The deal closed after four months, and I learned how critical management quality and competitive positioning are to achieving premium valuations."

**Leveraged Finance Example**: "I worked on a $500 million term loan B and senior secured notes package financing a private equity acquisition. My role was to model the company's debt capacity and support the credit presentation to lenders. The target company had stable but cyclical cash flows, which created sensitivity around leverage levels and covenant structures. I built the cash flow model, stress-tested various downside scenarios, and analyzed covenant headroom under different operating assumptions. The final structure included a 4.5x first lien term loan with maintenance covenants and 1.5x in senior unsecured notes. I learned how lenders evaluate credit risk and how to structure financing that balances borrower flexibility with creditor protection."

## Avoiding Common Framing Mistakes

Several framing mistakes consistently undermine banking analysts in PE interviews. First, excessive focus on process rather than analysis. Describing your role in managing timelines, coordinating workstreams, or organizing due diligence conveys project management skills but not analytical capability. Lead with your analytical contributions.

Second, failing to demonstrate judgment. Simply describing what happened on a deal is insufficient. Interviewers want to know what you thought about the deal, what risks concerned you, and whether you believed the price was appropriate. Show that you engaged with the transaction intellectually.

Third, not connecting experience to PE skills. Always make explicit links between what you did in banking and how it prepares you for PE. Your valuation experience prepares you for investment analysis. Your financing experience prepares you for capital structure work. Your client exposure prepares you for management interaction. Make these connections clear.

The goal of framing your banking deals is not just to describe your experience but to demonstrate that you are ready to transition from advisor to investor. Show that you have the technical skills, the analytical rigor, and most importantly, the mindset to evaluate investments from a principal's perspective.
