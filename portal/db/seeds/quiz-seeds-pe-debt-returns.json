      "question": "A Term Loan A (TLA) typically amortizes 5-10% of its principal per year, while a Term Loan B (TLB) typically amortizes only 1% per year. Why do lenders accept the lower TLB amortization rate?",
      "options": {
        "A": "TLB lenders accept lower amortization because they receive a higher interest rate spread to compensate for the longer duration and greater credit risk",
        "B": "TLB lenders are required by regulation to accept lower amortization rates",
        "C": "TLB amortization is lower because TLBs are always secured by better collateral than TLAs",
        "D": "TLB lenders prefer lower amortization because it reduces their tax burden on interest income"
      },
      "correct": "A",
      "explanation": "TLB lenders (typically institutional investors like CLOs and hedge funds) accept the minimal 1% annual amortization because they are compensated with a higher interest rate spread compared to TLA lenders (typically banks). The TLB structure gives them longer duration exposure to earn that higher spread, with the bulk of principal returned as a bullet payment at maturity. This is a fundamental risk-return tradeoff in leveraged lending.",

        "D": "8.25%"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "The total interest rate is the applicable SOFR rate plus the spread. Since the current SOFR rate (3.25%) exceeds the SOFR floor (1.00%), the actual SOFR rate is used. Total rate = 3.25% + 4.50% = 7.75%. The SOFR floor only comes into play when the actual SOFR rate falls below it, providing a minimum return to lenders.",

      "correct": "A",
      "explanation": "Net Debt / EBITDA = $480M / $85M = 5.65x, which is below the 6.0x threshold, so the company remains in compliance. However, it is worth noting how quickly declining EBITDA can push leverage toward covenant limits. If EBITDA fell another ~5% to $80M, leverage would hit 6.0x exactly.

      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "With PIK interest, the interest is not paid in cash but instead added to the principal balance, causing it to compound. Balance at maturity = $150M x (1.12)^5 = $150M x 1.7623 = ~$264M. This demonstrates the compounding cost of PIK debt — while it preserves cash flow during the hold period, the total debt burden at exit is significantly higher. The company owes $114M more at maturity than the original principal.",

      "options": {
        "A": "IRR is lower because the total capital deployed is the same but returns are delayed",
        "B": "IRR is higher because the second tranche has a shorter time to generate the same multiple, boosting the time-weighted return",

      "explanation": "When capital is called in tranches, the later-deployed capital has a shorter holding period to achieve the same return multiple. If the second 60% is deployed one year later and achieves 2.5x over 3 years instead of 4, its annualized return is higher (2.5^(1/3) - 1 = 35.7% vs 2.5^(1/4) - 1 = 25.7%). This blended result produces a higher portfolio IRR than investing everything upfront. This is why PE firms often structure capital calls strategically.",

      "explanation": "Gross IRR reflects returns before fund-level fees and expenses. Net IRR deducts management fees (typically 1.5-2% of committed capital annually) and carried interest (typically 20% of profits above the hurdle rate). A common rule of thumb is that net IRR is roughly 500-700 bps below gross IRR for a 2-and-20 structure, depending on fund size and deal timing.

Multiple expansion on exit EBITDA: ($9.0x - $8.0x) x $130M = $130M (35.1%). However, using the common decomposition: EBITDA growth contribution = $30M x 8.0x = $240M, and multiple expansion = 1.0x x $130M = $130M. So approximately 65%/35%, closest to answer B at 71%/29% using a slightly different but also standard decomposition method where EBITDA growth is measured at exit multiple: $30M x 9.0x = $270M (73%) and multiple expansion at entry EBITDA: 1.0x x $100M = $100M (27%).",

      "options": {
        "A": "No additional cost — soft call only applies to refinancing, not repricing",
        "B": "$5M — the 1% soft call premium applies to any principal repayment or repricing within the protection period",
        "C": "$10M — the soft call premium is 2% within the first 6 months",
        "D": "$0 — soft call protection expired at closing"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "The 101 soft call protection means the borrower must pay a 1% premium to repay, refinance, or reprice the loan within the first 6 months (some deals specify 12 months). At 4 months, the soft call is still in effect. Cost = 1% x $500M = $5M. This premium compensates lenders for the risk that their recently originated loan will be repriced at a lower spread shortly after they committed capital. The borrower must weigh the $5M one-time cost against the NPV of ongoing interest savings from the repricing.",

      "question": "A portfolio company refinances its $300M senior notes (8.0% coupon) with new notes at 6.5% coupon. The refinancing costs $4.5M in fees. If the notes have 3 years remaining to maturity, what is the approximate payback period for the refinancing fees?",
      "options": {
        "A": "1.0 year",
        "B": "0.5 years",
        "C": "2.0 years",
        "D": "The refinancing does not pay back within the remaining maturity"
      },
      "correct": "A",
      "explanation": "Annual interest savings = $300M x (8.0% - 6.5%) = $300M x 1.5% = $4.5M per year. Payback period = Refinancing fees / Annual savings = $4.5M / $4.5M = 1.0 year. With 3 years remaining, the net savings over the remaining term = ($4.5M x 3) - $4.5M = $9.0M. This is a clear refinancing opportunity. The rule of thumb is that refinancing is attractive when the payback period is well within the remaining loan term, and here the company saves 2 additional years of interest after recovering fees.",

        "A": "The model automatically reduces debt to bring the ratio back into compliance",
        "B": "Nothing — covenant breaches have no modeling implications",

      },
      "correct": "C",
      "explanation": "A maintenance covenant breach is a serious event. In practice, it triggers a technical default under the credit agreement, giving lenders the right to accelerate (demand immediate repayment of) the debt. However, acceleration is rare — more commonly, the borrower negotiates a waiver or amendment with lenders, which typically involves paying a fee, accepting tighter terms, and possibly providing additional collateral or equity. In an LBO model, a covenant breach is flagged as a critical risk indicator, signaling that the deal structure may not work under stress scenarios.",

      "question": "A PE fund is comparing two investments: Deal A offers 3.0x MOIC / 20% IRR, and Deal B offers 2.0x MOIC / 30% IRR. Assuming the fund has sufficient capital and a 10-year fund life, which deal creates more absolute value for LPs?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Deal B, because the higher IRR means faster compounding of capital",
        "B": "Deal A, because the 3.0x MOIC generates more absolute dollars per dollar invested, and the fund can reinvest for the remaining fund life",
        "C": "It depends on the hold period and whether the fund can reinvest at similar returns during the remaining fund life",
        "D": "They are equivalent because IRR and MOIC are interchangeable measures"
      },
      "correct": "C",
      "explanation": "This is a classic PE interview question about the tension between IRR and MOIC. Deal B has higher IRR but lower MOIC, meaning it generates returns faster but at a lower absolute level. Deal A generates more absolute dollars but takes longer. The answer depends on the reinvestment assumption: if Deal B's capital can be reinvested at similar IRRs, it may generate more terminal wealth. But PE funds face 'reinvestment risk' — redeploying capital at the same returns is not guaranteed. This is why sophisticated LPs evaluate both metrics together.",

      "question": "A TLB credit agreement includes a 'most favored nation' (MFN) clause with a 50 bps sunset provision. The original TLB was issued at SOFR + 400 bps. A new incremental TLB is issued at SOFR + 500 bps. What happens to the original TLB's pricing?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Nothing — the original TLB pricing is fixed and cannot change",

      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "An MFN clause protects existing lenders by requiring that if new debt is issued at a wider spread, the existing debt's spread must be increased to match (or come within a specified threshold). The 50 bps sunset provision means the existing TLB spread must be brought within 50 bps of the new debt's spread. New spread = SOFR + 500 bps. Original spread adjusted = SOFR + 500 - 50 = SOFR + 450 bps. This increases the company's interest cost on the existing TLB and is a key structural provision that affects incremental debt capacity and cost in LBO models.",

      "options": {
        "A": "It has no impact on the debt schedule or returns",
        "B": "The increased depreciation and amortization from the asset step-up reduces taxable income, increasing after-tax cash flow available for debt service, thereby accelerating debt paydown and improving equity returns",
        "C": "It increases the purchase price by the amount of the step-up, requiring more debt",
        "D": "It eliminates the need for a debt schedule entirely because the tax savings replace debt financing"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "A 338(h)(10) election allows the buyer to treat a stock purchase as an asset purchase for tax purposes, stepping up the tax basis of the target's assets to the purchase price. This creates additional depreciation and amortization deductions, which reduce taxable income and cash taxes paid. The higher after-tax cash flow can be used to repay debt faster, improving the equity return. In an LBO model, this shows up as lower cash taxes, higher free cash flow, faster de-leveraging, and ultimately higher exit equity value and IRR. The benefit can be substantial — often adding 100-300+ bps to IRR.",

      "explanation": "When SOFR (0.50%) falls below the floor, the floor rate is used instead. TLB: Floor of 1.00% (since 0.50% < 1.00%) + 400 bps spread = 5.00%. Second Lien: Floor of 2.00% (since 0.50% < 2.00%) + 800 bps spread = 10.00%. The SOFR floors protect lenders' minimum returns in low-rate environments. Note the second lien has a higher floor AND higher spread, reflecting its greater credit risk (junior position in the capital structure).
