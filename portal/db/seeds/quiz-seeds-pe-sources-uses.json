      },
      "correct": "A",
      "explanation": "An undrawn revolving credit facility is NOT included as a source in the Sources & Uses table. The revolver is typically put in place for liquidity purposes (funding working capital needs post-close) but is not drawn at closing. Only instruments that are actually funded at close appear as sources. The term loan, sponsor equity, and management rollover are all funded at close and belong in sources.",

      "explanation": "Total Uses = Purchase Enterprise Value ($500M) + Fees ($25M) + Refinanced Debt ($80M) + Cash to Balance Sheet ($5M) = $610M. A common mistake is forgetting to include the refinanced debt or the cash to the balance sheet.

      "correct": "C",
      "explanation": "If management rolls over 15% of total equity, then the sponsor provides the remaining 85%. Sponsor equity = 85% of total equity, so $170M = 0.85 * Total Equity. Total Equity = $170M / 0.85 = $200.0M. The management rollover portion is $200M * 15% = $30M. This is a common interview calculation testing your ability to work backward from a percentage split.",

        "A": "Higher leverage reduces the purchase price of the target",

        "D": "Higher leverage always reduces the blended cost of capital because debt is tax-deductible"
      },
      "correct": "C",
      "explanation": "PE sponsors prefer higher leverage because it reduces the equity check (the amount of their own capital they must invest). With less equity invested, the same absolute dollar return translates into a higher percentage return (higher IRR and MOIC). This is the core principle of financial leverage. While the tax-deductibility of interest is a benefit, it alone does not explain the preference — the primary driver is the amplification of equity returns. Higher leverage does not reduce the purchase price.",

This represents the amount of equity (sponsor + any rollover) needed to fund the acquisition on top of the debt raised. This is a foundational LBO concept — equity is the residual claim after debt.",

      "options": {
        "A": "It reduces the sponsor's equity check by acting as a source of financing, but PIK interest will increase the note's balance over time",
        "B": "It increases total uses because the seller note is an additional cost",

        "D": "It must be repaid within the first year of the holding period"
      },
      "correct": "A",
      "explanation": "A seller note is a form of seller financing that appears on the Sources side. It reduces the amount of equity the sponsor must contribute. Because it carries PIK (payment-in-kind) interest, no cash interest is paid — instead, the principal balance of the note grows over time as unpaid interest is added to the balance. This defers cash outflows but increases the total amount owed at maturity. Seller notes do not replace bank debt; they supplement the capital structure.",

      },
      "correct": "D",
      "explanation": "Cash is subtracted in the Equity-to-Enterprise Value bridge because it is a non-operating asset that could theoretically be used to pay down debt. Since we add total debt to get to Enterprise Value, we subtract cash to arrive at 'net debt' (Debt - Cash). The acquirer effectively 'gets' the cash on the balance sheet when purchasing the company, offsetting part of the purchase cost.

      "correct": "A",
      "explanation": "Under ASC 842 / IFRS 16, both finance (capital) leases and operating leases are recognized on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. For consistency in the EV bridge, both types of lease liabilities should be added to Enterprise Value, since the corresponding lease expenses (rental costs) have been removed from operating expenses.

      "explanation": "The EBITDA margin assumption is critical because EBITDA is the primary measure of operating cash generation in an LBO. It determines how much cash is available to pay interest, repay debt, and fund capital expenditures. If EBITDA margins deteriorate, the company may not generate sufficient cash flow to service its debt, leading to covenant breaches or default. EBITDA margins also affect the exit valuation (Exit EBITDA * Exit Multiple = Exit EV).",
