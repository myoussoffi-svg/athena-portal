      "question": "You're evaluating a B2B SaaS company with 95% gross retention but only 85% net retention. What should be your PRIMARY concern?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Customer acquisition costs are too high",
        "B": "The product lacks expansion potential within existing accounts",
        "C": "The company is losing too many customers",
        "D": "The pricing model is fundamentally broken"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "95% gross retention means customers are staying (only 5% churn), so C is wrong. The gap between gross (95%) and net (85%) retention indicates existing customers aren't expanding - they're either not buying more seats, not upgrading, or are downsizing. This suggests limited upsell/cross-sell opportunity, which constrains organic growth and makes the growth story dependent on new logo acquisition.",

      "question": "A PE fund is evaluating a healthcare IT company. Revenue grew 40% last year, but the sales team doubled. What is the MOST important follow-up question?",
      "options": {
        "A": "What is the customer acquisition cost?",
        "B": "What is the sales team's quota attainment and ramping efficiency?",
        "C": "How much runway does the company have?",
        "D": "What is the company's NPS score?"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "If the sales team doubled but revenue only grew 40%, something is wrong with sales productivity. You need to understand if new reps are ramping slowly (fixable) or if quota attainment across the board is declining (concerning). This directly impacts the scalability thesis. A and D are relevant but secondary; C is a capitalization question not core to the business model.",

      "question": "You're building an investment thesis for a regional HVAC services roll-up. Which value creation lever is LEAST likely to materialize?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Procurement savings through centralized purchasing",
        "B": "Revenue synergies from cross-selling across geographies",
        "C": "Margin improvement through technician route optimization",
        "D": "Multiple arbitrage from creating a scaled platform"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "HVAC services are inherently local - customers hire based on proximity and local reputation. Cross-selling across geographies provides minimal value since an HVAC company in Dallas can't service customers in Atlanta. A, C, and D are proven roll-up playbooks: centralized procurement drives savings, route density improves margins, and scaled platforms command higher multiples than single-location operators.",

      "question": "A target company has 70% of revenue from its top 3 customers. Management says long-term contracts mitigate concentration risk. What is the BEST counterargument?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Long-term contracts often have termination for convenience clauses",
        "B": "The contracts may not be at market rates",
        "C": "Customer concentration increases working capital needs",
        "D": "Revenue recognition may be complex"
      },
      "correct": "A",
      "explanation": "Most enterprise contracts include 'termination for convenience' clauses (typically 30-90 day notice), meaning the customer can exit without cause. A contract is only as good as its enforceability. B is a pricing concern not a concentration risk counter. C and D are operational issues, not direct rebuttals to the mitigation claim.",

      "options": {
        "A": "Total addressable market size",
        "B": "Unit economics sustainability at scale",
        "C": "Management team track record",
        "D": "Competitive differentiation"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "For subscription businesses, proving that you make money on each customer (LTV > CAC by 3x+, payback < 18 months) is foundational. Without positive unit economics, TAM is irrelevant - you'd lose money on every incremental customer. Competitive differentiation matters, but even differentiated products fail if unit economics don't work. Management matters but can be upgraded.",

      "options": {
        "A": "The company is investing in growth",
        "B": "There is significant operating expense bloat",
        "C": "Revenue quality is deteriorating",
        "D": "The company has pricing power"
      },
      "correct": "A",
      "explanation": "Rising gross margins with flat EBITDA margins typically means the company is reinvesting gross margin expansion into S&M or R&D - a growth investment posture. This is often the right strategy for a scaling software company. B is possible but 'bloat' implies waste rather than intentional investment. C contradicts the gross margin improvement. D is partially true but doesn't explain the EBITDA margin dynamic.",

      "question": "You're evaluating two platform investments: Company A has a 'single-player' use case, Company B requires a network effect to deliver value. Which has a stronger investment thesis, all else equal?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Company A - less execution risk to initial value",
        "B": "Company B - network effects create defensibility",
        "C": "Neither is inherently stronger - depends on stage",
        "D": "Company B - viral growth is more capital efficient"
      },
      "correct": "C",
      "explanation": "Both models can be excellent investments. Single-player products are easier to launch (value from day one) but may face more competition. Network-effect businesses are harder to start but create moats once scaled. For early-stage, single-player often de-risks the investment. For growth-stage, proven network effects can justify higher multiples. Context matters enormously.",

      "question": "A PE firm is evaluating a founder-led company where the founder owns 80% and wants to sell 100%. What is the MOST significant risk to the thesis?",
      "options": {
        "A": "The founder will take all the cash off the table",
        "B": "The business may be over-dependent on founder relationships",
        "C": "Valuation expectations will be unrealistic",
        "D": "The founder won't cooperate during transition"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "When a founder owns 80% and wants full liquidity, the fundamental question is: does the business work without them? Key customer relationships, supplier terms, employee loyalty, and institutional knowledge often rest with founders. This is the core investment risk. A is a deal structure issue, not a business risk. C and D are negotiation challenges, not thesis risks.",

      "options": {
        "A": "Suboptimal pricing strategy",
        "B": "Weak financial reporting and controls",
        "C": "Declining end market",
        "D": "Underperforming sales team"
      },
      "correct": "C",
      "explanation": "You can fix pricing (often quickly), improve reporting/controls (6-12 months), and upgrade the sales team (12-18 months). But you cannot fix a structurally declining end market - that's an external factor outside your control. Secular decline is a 'ride the wave down' situation. Everything else is operational execution that PE firms regularly address.",

      "question": "A company generates $50M revenue with 60% from recurring sources and 40% from project-based work. What's the MOST compelling path to thesis construction?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Focus on growing the project-based revenue for upside",
        "B": "Convert project-based revenue to recurring through productization",
        "C": "Acquire companies with higher recurring revenue mix",
        "D": "Raise prices on the recurring revenue base"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "Converting project-based work to recurring (productizing services, introducing maintenance contracts, subscription models) creates multiple expansion through improved revenue quality. This is a proven PE playbook. A grows revenue but doesn't improve quality. C adds complexity and integration risk. D is a tactic, not a transformation thesis.",

      "options": {
        "A": "Adjust the revenue forecast downward",
        "B": "Request customer interviews with those 3 accounts",
        "C": "Review historical ordering patterns for seasonality",
        "D": "Ask management to explain the situation"
      },
      "correct": "C",
      "explanation": "Before escalating or adjusting forecasts, check if this is normal. Many B2B manufacturing customers have lumpy ordering patterns (annual contracts, project-based purchases, seasonal demand). Review 2-3 years of order history first. If ordering is typically lumpy, this may be a non-issue. If these customers historically ordered monthly and stopped, then you escalate to B and D.",

      "question": "You're conducting QoE (Quality of Earnings) and find that 15% of EBITDA comes from 'cost savings initiatives not yet implemented.' How should this be treated?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Include it as management demonstrates a credible plan",
        "B": "Exclude it entirely from your base case",
        "C": "Include 50% as a risk-adjusted estimate",
        "D": "Include it only if savings are from headcount reductions"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "Unimplemented cost savings are not earnings - they're projections. QoE should reflect actual, sustainable earnings from the existing business. Future savings belong in your value creation plan and deal model upside cases, not in the baseline EBITDA you're underwriting. If management has a credible plan, that's thesis upside, not current earnings quality.",

      "question": "A SaaS company claims 90% gross margins, but due diligence reveals significant costs are capitalized as R&D. What's the MOST important next step?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Recalculate gross margins with R&D expensed",
        "B": "Understand what percentage of R&D is maintenance vs. new product",
        "C": "Compare capitalization policy to industry peers",
        "D": "Review the auditor's treatment of the capitalization"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "The key insight is whether R&D spending maintains the existing product (should arguably be in cost structure) or creates new value (legitimately capitalizable). If 80% of R&D is maintenance/bug fixes/infrastructure, the 'true' margin profile is much worse. C provides context but doesn't answer the substantive question. A is mechanical; you need to understand what's being capitalized first.",

        "D": "Non-compete agreements that may not be enforceable"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "DOJ subpoenas related to billing practices in healthcare can result in massive penalties, exclusion from federal programs (Medicare/Medicaid), and even criminal liability. An 18-month-old unresolved subpoena suggests an active investigation. A is routine HR litigation. C is likely administrative (renew the licenses). D is common and rarely material. B is existential risk.",

      "question": "Management presents a customer cohort analysis showing 120% net dollar retention. What is the MOST critical diligence question?",
      "options": {
        "A": "How is 'cohort' defined - by contract start date or first payment?",
        "B": "Are expansion revenues from price increases or volume growth?",
        "C": "What does retention look like excluding the top 10 customers?",
        "D": "Is this consistent with disclosed churn rates?"
      },
      "correct": "C",
      "explanation": "Blended metrics can hide significant variance. If 120% NDR is driven by massive expansion in 2-3 large accounts while the long tail churns at 20%, the business is much riskier than the headline suggests. Concentration in expansion revenue is a red flag. A and D are good hygiene questions. B is interesting but secondary to understanding if NDR is broad-based or concentrated.",

      "options": {
        "A": "It's a deal-breaker - the technology risk is too high",
        "B": "It's a value creation opportunity - budget for modernization",
        "C": "It's neutral - if it works, don't fix it",
        "D": "It requires deep technical diligence to assess rebuild cost and risk"
      },
      "correct": "D",
      "explanation": "Legacy technology is neither automatically bad nor good - it requires expert assessment. Key questions: Can you hire people who know this stack? What's the rebuild cost? What breaks if the original developer leaves? Is it a security risk? After technical diligence, this might become a deal-breaker, a value creation opportunity, or a manageable risk. Don't prejudge without data.",

        "B": "Obsolescence risk and inventory write-down history",
        "C": "Whether this reflects strategic pre-buying or demand softening",
        "D": "Days inventory outstanding trend versus peers"
      },
      "correct": "C",
      "explanation": "Before mechanical adjustments (A) or historical analysis (B, D), understand WHY inventory spiked. If management strategically bought ahead of price increases or supply constraints, that's smart. If inventory grew because sales slowed and production didn't adjust, that's a demand signal. If it's channel stuffing, that's fraud. The 'why' drives everything else.",

        "D": "Discount the feedback as competitive FUD"
      },
      "correct": "C",
      "explanation": "When multiple customers independently raise the same concern, something is driving that perception. Did the company miss deliverables? Lay off customer-facing staff? Have visible turnover? Change payment terms? Understanding the source tells you about both the business reality and reputational damage that may affect renewals. B might be true but doesn't address the diagnostic question.",

        "D": "Complete Phase II testing before proceeding to closing"
      },
      "correct": "D",
      "explanation": "Environmental contamination can create unlimited liability (CERCLA has no cap). Closing without testing (A) is reckless. Walking away (B) may be premature. Escrow/indemnity (C) is reasonable but how do you size it without testing? The 60-day delay is worth the certainty. If the seller won't wait, that itself is a red flag.

      },
      "correct": "C",
      "explanation": "Understanding the 'bridge' (volume vs. price vs. cost savings vs. new products) tells you what's actually driving the projection and where risk lies. Contracts (A) prove revenue exists but don't show margin or cost assumptions. Historical accuracy (B) is useful context. Customer confirmation (D) is valuable but narrow. The bridge reveals whether the 30% is achievable and where it could break.",

      },
      "correct": "C",
      "explanation": "The irony of compliance software: it depends on regulation, but regulation changes. Major regulatory rewrites (think Dodd-Frank changes, GDPR, new frameworks) can obsolete existing products overnight, requiring massive R&D spend just to maintain relevance. You're running to stand still. A is a risk but regulations rarely disappear entirely. B and D are competitive pressures, not thesis-breakers.",

      "correct": "D",
      "explanation": "Abnormally high margins are a beacon for competition. Unless there's a durable moat (patents, network effects, regulatory licenses), competitors will enter and margins will compress toward industry norms. The value creation thesis cannot rely on margin expansion when margins are already at outlier levels. This is basic microeconomics - excess returns attract entry.",

      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "With 80% concentration in one customer, you're essentially underwriting that customer's business. If the tech company has layoffs or a hiring freeze (common in tech cycles), your revenue collapses. The other risks exist but are secondary: in-sourcing (A) is rare for large-scale staffing; reclassification (C) affects the industry, not you specifically; rebidding (D) is a risk but less immediate than demand decline.

      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "Government shutdown, continuing resolutions (CRs), and sequestration can freeze or cut spending unpredictably. During CRs, agencies can't start new programs and often can't even renew existing contracts. This macro-fiscal risk is outside your control and can materially impact even well-performing contractors. A, C, and D are real but more predictable/manageable. B is the systemic risk.",

      "explanation": "During license-to-SaaS transitions, total revenue typically DECLINES (you're trading upfront payments for smaller recurring ones). Gross margins may initially decline (SaaS requires hosting/support infrastructure). What matters is: Are customers adopting SaaS (ARR growth)? Are they staying (retention)?

When acquiring a private company, you're also acquiring full control, so the control value component IS relevant. The key distinction is that public-to-private premiums also include a liquidity premium (public shareholders demand compensation for losing liquid stock), which is less relevant for a private-to-private transaction.
