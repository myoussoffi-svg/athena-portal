      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "PIK interest compounds: $100M × (1.12)^5 = $176.2M, approximately $176M. Each year the unpaid interest is added to the principal, so the balance grows exponentially rather than linearly. If it were simple interest, the balance would be $160M ($100M + 5 × $12M), which is a common wrong answer.",

        "D": "$300M"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "The 2x liquidation preference entitles the preferred holder to $400M (2 × $200M). However, the total proceeds are only $350M. The preferred holder receives the full $350M, as their preference exceeds the available proceeds. Common equity receives nothing. The preferred cannot receive more than the total enterprise value available for distribution.",

        "D": "PIK debt triggers higher taxes due to phantom income recognition"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "With cash-pay debt, interest payments reduce the debt balance over time (through amortization of the original principal). With PIK, the balance grows because unpaid interest accretes to principal. At exit, the larger debt balance is subtracted from enterprise value, leaving less equity value. While PIK preserves near-term cash flow (helpful for debt service coverage), the compounding effect reduces the sponsor's share of exit proceeds, lowering the equity MOIC and IRR.",

      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "PIK dividends compound annually: $50M × (1.10)^4 = $50M × 1.4641 = $73.2M. The key distinction from simple interest ($70M) is that each year's accrued dividend is added to the preference base, and subsequent dividends accrue on this larger base. This compounding mechanism is identical to PIK debt mechanics and significantly increases the preferred holder's claim over time.",

      "question": "A PE firm owns a portfolio company valued at $800M EV with $200M of existing debt. It executes a dividend recapitalization, raising $300M of new debt and distributing the proceeds to equity holders. What is the impact on the sponsor's IRR?",
      "options": {
        "A": "IRR increases because the sponsor recovers capital earlier, reducing time-weighted exposure",
        "B": "IRR decreases because the company now has more debt and higher risk",

        "D": "IRR increases only if the dividend exceeds the original equity check"
      },
      "correct": "A",
      "explanation": "A dividend recapitalization accelerates cash returns to the sponsor, reducing the time capital is at risk. Since IRR is time-weighted, receiving cash earlier significantly boosts the return rate even if total dollar profit (MOIC) stays the same or slightly decreases. The MOIC may actually decline slightly due to higher interest expense, but the earlier cash inflow typically more than offsets this in IRR terms. This is one of the classic PE value creation levers.",

      "explanation": "The waterfall allocates value by priority: First lien receives $300M (100% recovery). Remaining value = $420M - $300M = $120M for second lien. Second lien recovery = $120M / $200M = 60%. Unsecured bonds recover 0% as there is no remaining value. This strict priority of claims (the 'absolute priority rule') is fundamental to distressed analysis and determines which tranche is the 'fulcrum security.'",

        "D": "$80M (preference plus pro-rata share of excess)"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "Non-participating preferred gives the holder a choice: take the liquidation preference ($50M) OR convert to common stock (30% × $200M = $60M). The holder picks whichever is higher. Here, converting yields $60M vs. the $50M preference, so the holder converts. Note: if this were participating preferred, the holder would receive $50M + 30% × ($200M - $50M) = $50M + $45M = $95M.

      },
      "correct": "D",
      "explanation": "Setting the option strike at fair market value (the acquisition price per share) serves two purposes. First, it aligns incentives: management only benefits from value creation above the entry price, ensuring they are motivated to grow the business. Second, Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code requires that options be granted at or above FMV to avoid being treated as deferred compensation, which would trigger immediate taxation and a 20% penalty. This is why 409A valuations are a critical step in structuring management incentive plans.",

      },
      "correct": "A",
      "explanation": "A Holdco/Opco structure creates a parent (Holdco) above the operating company (Opco). The sponsor can place senior secured debt at the Opco level and additional subordinated or holdco notes at the Holdco level, effectively layering more leverage on the equity. Holdco debt is structurally subordinated to Opco debt because Holdco's only asset is its equity in Opco, meaning Opco creditors are paid first. This structure is more complex (not simpler) and typically requires intercreditor arrangements, but it enables greater total leverage.",

      "options": {
        "A": "Holdco lenders have a contractual agreement to be paid after Opco lenders",
        "B": "Holdco creditors can only access Opco cash flows after Opco's own obligations are satisfied, because Holdco's only asset is its equity interest in Opco",

        "D": "Holdco lenders rank pari passu with Opco's unsecured creditors"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "Structural subordination arises from the corporate structure itself, not from a contractual agreement. Holdco's sole asset is its equity in Opco. In a distress scenario, Opco's creditors have first claim on Opco's assets and cash flows. Only after all Opco obligations (debt, payables, etc.) are satisfied does any residual value flow up to Holdco as equity distributions, which Holdco can then use to service its own debt. This is different from contractual subordination, which is an explicit agreement between lenders within the same entity.",

      "explanation": "The restricted payments covenant limits distributions from Opco to Holdco based on a basket—here, 50% of cumulative net income since closing. 50% × $80M = $40M maximum distribution. Even though Opco has $50M of free cash flow, the covenant limits the dividend to $40M. This is a critical concept in Holdco/Opco modeling: Holdco's ability to service its own debt depends entirely on distributions from Opco, which are constrained by Opco's credit agreement covenants.",

      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "Opco's external lenders will require that any intercompany loans from Holdco to Opco are contractually subordinated to their claims. This is typically mandated in the intercreditor or subordination agreement. While the loans do eliminate in consolidation for accounting purposes, they remain legally distinct claims in bankruptcy. External lenders would never accept intercompany debt ranking ahead of or alongside their secured claims—subordination is a standard protective provision.",

      },
      "correct": "A",
      "explanation": "When Holdco and Opco file a consolidated tax return (possible when Holdco owns 80%+ of Opco), interest expense on Holdco debt can offset taxable income from Opco at the consolidated group level. This creates a tax shield on the Holdco debt, making the additional leverage layer tax-efficient.

      "explanation": "The additional $150M could be placed as second lien debt at Opco (contractually subordinated to first lien but with a direct claim on Opco assets) or as holdco notes (structurally subordinated). The choice depends on: (1) whether the existing Opco credit agreement permits additional second lien debt, (2) market appetite and pricing for each tranche, and (3) the sponsor's preference for flexibility. Second lien at Opco typically prices tighter than holdco notes because it has a direct claim on Opco assets, but it may face more restrictive covenants.",

Covenant-lite term loans eliminate maintenance covenants, removing the lender's ability to force a default based on deteriorating performance alone.

After the make-whole period, bonds become callable at a declining fixed premium schedule (e.g., half-coupon, then par).",

It is cheaper than a full refinancing because it avoids new OID, arrangement fees, and the administrative cost of a new credit agreement. However, repricing triggers the same soft call protection as a refinancing. From a lender perspective, repricing is often unwelcome because it reduces their yield without providing any new economics. In a full refinancing, the old loan is repaid and a new loan is issued, potentially with different terms, maturity, covenants, and lender group.",

        "A": "Pay $650M upfront to win the deal",
        "B": "Structure a $50M earnout payable if the pipeline converts and achieves $50M in recurring revenue within 12-18 months, with partial payouts for partial achievement",
        "C": "Walk away from the deal entirely",
        "D": "Ask the seller to guarantee the pipeline will convert or refund the purchase price"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "This is a classic earnout use case: the seller values the pipeline at $50M, but the buyer is unwilling to pay for unrealized revenue. A well-structured earnout bridges this gap by tying the incremental $50M to the pipeline actually converting to recurring revenue. Key structuring elements: (1) clear metric definition (what counts as 'recurring revenue'), (2) measurement period (12-18 months is reasonable for pipeline conversion), (3) linear or tiered payout (partial payout for partial achievement incentivizes the seller even if 100% conversion doesn't occur), and (4) seller protections against buyer deliberately sabotaging pipeline conversion. This structure fairly transfers execution risk while giving the seller the opportunity to earn the full $650M valuation.",

      "question": "A portfolio company's LBO model shows an entry at 5.5x leverage (Debt/EBITDA). The company operates in a highly cyclical industrial sector. A senior lender pushes back on the leverage level. Which of the following is the most credible response?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Cyclical companies can support the same leverage as non-cyclical companies because they grow faster in upturns",
        "B": "The model stress-tests a 25% EBITDA decline and shows the company maintains a minimum 1.2x fixed charge coverage ratio and does not breach covenants, supported by low capex needs and a strong cash cushion",
        "C": "The sponsor will inject additional equity if the company's performance deteriorates",
        "D": "5.5x is below the market average for leveraged loans, so it is conservative"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "The credible response demonstrates that the borrower can withstand cyclical stress while maintaining adequate debt service coverage. Showing a specific downside scenario (25% EBITDA decline) with quantified impacts on coverage ratios and covenant compliance addresses the lender's core concern directly. Vague assurances about sponsor support (option C) are not bankable, and market average leverage (option D) is irrelevant to the specific risk profile of a cyclical business. PE sponsors should always model a realistic trough scenario for cyclical businesses and present it proactively to lenders to build confidence in the borrower's resilience.",

      "question": "A PE-owned SaaS company has $80M ARR growing 30% YoY with 75% gross margins and -5% EBITDA margin. The company is considering taking on $200M of recurring revenue-based debt (2.5x ARR). What unique risk does this underwriting approach present?",
      "options": {
        "A": "No risk—ARR-based lending is safer than EBITDA-based lending",
        "B": "If growth decelerates or churn increases, ARR may not convert to sufficient cash flow to service the debt, as the company is currently EBITDA-negative and debt service depends on future profitability improvements",
        "C": "SaaS companies never default because of recurring revenue",
        "D": "The risk is limited to currency fluctuation"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "ARR-based lending assumes that recurring revenue will eventually convert to positive cash flow sufficient for debt service. The core risk is that the company is currently burning cash (-5% EBITDA margin) and the lending thesis depends on: (1) continued revenue growth, (2) operating leverage driving margin expansion, and (3) no significant increase in churn. If growth decelerates (e.g., from 30% to 10%), the company may never achieve sufficient profitability to cover interest payments. Unlike traditional EBITDA-based lending where current cash flow covers debt service, ARR-based lending is essentially lending against future profitability—a fundamentally different and riskier proposition. This risk was crystallized in 2022-2023 when several PE-backed SaaS companies struggled with debt service after growth decelerated.",

        "A": "The Opco from making acquisitions without lender consent",

      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "The 'J. Crew' blocker (named after J. Crew's controversial 2017 transaction) prevents the borrower from transferring valuable assets—particularly intellectual property—to unrestricted subsidiaries that sit outside the lender group's collateral package. In the J. Crew case, the company transferred its valuable brand IP to a subsidiary not pledged as collateral, then used that IP as collateral for new financing, effectively subordinating existing lenders. This exploit used permissive restricted subsidiary and investment covenant baskets. Modern credit agreements now include specific anti-J. Crew provisions preventing material IP or asset transfers to unrestricted subsidiaries. This is one of the most important recent developments in leveraged finance documentation.",

      "question": "When a PE firm models a leveraged recapitalization in Year 2 of a 5-year hold, how should the incremental debt from the recap be reflected in the exit equity bridge?",
      "options": {
        "A": "The recap debt is ignored at exit because it was used for a dividend",
        "B": "The recap debt increases total debt at exit, reducing exit equity value, but the sponsor has already received the dividend proceeds—net effect on total MOIC depends on debt paydown between Year 2 and exit",
        "C": "The recap debt is subtracted from the entry equity check to reduce the basis",
        "D": "The recap debt is added to enterprise value at exit"
      },
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "In the exit equity bridge: Exit EV - Total Net Debt (including recap debt still outstanding) = Exit Equity. The recap debt increases the debt balance, reducing exit equity. However, the sponsor already received the dividend in Year 2, which counts as a return of capital. Total MOIC calculation considers both the dividend received AND the exit equity proceeds, divided by the original equity check. If the company has paid down some or all of the recap debt by exit, the impact on exit equity is mitigated. The net effect: recap boosts IRR (earlier cash) but may slightly reduce MOIC (due to interest expense reducing cumulative cash flow and paydown capacity). This is a critical modeling exercise for PE associates.",

      "question": "A PE portfolio company has both a first lien term loan (L+350) and second lien notes (12% fixed). The company is performing well and wants to refinance both tranches into a single unitranche at L+500. Aside from call premiums, what is the key consideration in determining whether this refinancing creates value?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Whether the unitranche spread is lower than the weighted average cost of the existing first and second lien combined",
        "B": "Whether the unitranche lender has a better reputation than the existing lenders",
        "C": "Whether the unitranche documentation allows for more flexibility in restricted payments and investments, not just the interest rate comparison",
        "D": "Both A and C—the analysis must consider the all-in cost saving AND the incremental flexibility gained from the new documentation"
      },
      "correct": "D",
      "explanation": "Value creation from refinancing depends on both economics and flexibility. Economically, compare the blended cost: if the existing weighted average cost is L+350 (60% first lien) + 12% (40% second lien) ≈ 6.9% blended vs. L+500 ≈ 5.0% + base rate, the math depends on the rate environment. But equally important is documentation flexibility: unitranche agreements often provide greater covenant flexibility, larger permitted baskets for investments and restricted payments, and a simpler lender group (often a single direct lender) that is easier to negotiate with for future amendments. This flexibility can be more valuable than pure interest savings—for example, the ability to do a bolt-on acquisition or dividend recap that would be restricted under the existing two-tranche structure. Sophisticated PE associates evaluate both dimensions.",
