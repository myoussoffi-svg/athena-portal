## Written Guide

### The Reality of IB Recruiting

Investment banking recruiting isn't a meritocracy based purely on credentials. Two candidates with identical resumes, GPAs, and technical skills will have dramatically different outcomes based on one variable: who knows them inside the bank.

This isn't cynicism—it's how the process actually works. Banks receive thousands of applications for a handful of spots. Recruiters and hiring managers can't evaluate every candidate thoroughly. They rely on internal signals: "Has anyone here spoken with this person? Does anyone vouch for them?"

Outreach creates those signals. A candidate who has had three informational calls with analysts and associates at a bank is a known quantity. A candidate who applied cold is a stranger.

### What Outreach Actually Accomplishes

Effective outreach produces four concrete outcomes:

**1. Name recognition in the applicant pool**

When your resume lands on a recruiter's desk, you want someone at the bank to say, "I've talked to this person—they're solid." This single sentence can move you from the reject pile to the interview pile.

**2. Information that improves your application**

People inside the bank know what the group actually values, what recent deals they've worked on, and what interviewers tend to ask. This information makes your cover letter sharper, your "why this firm" answer more specific, and your technical preparation more targeted.

**3. Direct referrals and resume drops**

At many banks, employees can submit candidates directly to recruiting. A referral from a current analyst or associate is one of the most reliable ways to secure a first-round interview.

**4. Interview preparation from people who've been through it**

The best way to prepare for an interview is to talk to someone who interviewed at the same group recently. They can tell you which interviewers you'll face, what questions came up, and what the group cares about.

### The Numbers You Should Expect

Outreach is a volume game with a low hit rate. Understanding the math prevents discouragement:

- **Cold email response rate**: 10-20% for well-written emails to appropriate contacts
- **Emails needed for one call**: 5-10 emails typically yield 1-2 conversations
- **Calls needed to build a relationship**: 2-3 touchpoints with the same person creates recognition
- **Relationships needed per target bank**: 3-5 people who know you meaningfully

This means reaching your target list of 5-8 banks requires sending 100-200 emails over the course of recruiting season. Most students underestimate this volume.

### When Outreach Has the Highest Impact

Outreach matters at every stage, but the return on effort varies:

**Highest impact**: 2-4 months before applications open. You have time to build relationships, and contacts aren't yet overwhelmed with requests.

**Medium impact**: During application season. Your outreach can still influence whether you get an interview, but competition for attention is fierce.

**Lower impact**: After you've submitted applications but before decisions. Useful for gathering intelligence, but the window for influencing outcomes is narrow.

**Still valuable**: After receiving an interview. Talking to people at the bank helps you prepare and signals continued interest.

### The Outreach Mindset

Effective outreach requires a specific mindset:

**You're not asking for a job.** You're asking for 15-20 minutes of someone's time to learn about their experience. This is a reasonable request that professionals grant regularly.

**Rejection is data, not failure.** Most emails won't get responses. This reflects how busy people are, not your worth as a candidate.

**Consistency beats intensity.** Sending five emails per week for three months produces better results than sending fifty emails in one week and then stopping.

**Quality of conversation matters more than quantity of contacts.** One person who remembers you and advocates for you is worth more than ten people who vaguely recall receiving your email.

## Key Takeaways

- IB recruiting favors candidates who are known inside the bank over equally qualified strangers
- Outreach produces four outcomes: name recognition, information, referrals, and interview prep
- Expect 10-20% response rates on cold emails; plan for 100-200 emails across your target banks
- Start outreach 2-4 months before applications open for maximum impact
- You're asking for a conversation, not a job—this is a reasonable professional request
