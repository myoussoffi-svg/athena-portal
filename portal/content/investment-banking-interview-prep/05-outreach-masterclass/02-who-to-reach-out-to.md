# Who to Reach Out To and In What Order

## Learning Objectives

- Identify the categories of people who can help your IB recruiting efforts
- Understand the relative value and accessibility of each contact type
- Build a prioritized outreach list based on connection strength and relevance
- Find contact information using appropriate professional methods

## Written Guide

### The Contact Hierarchy

Not all contacts are equally valuable or equally accessible. Understanding this hierarchy helps you allocate your limited time and social capital effectively.

**Tier 1: Warm connections (highest response rate, highest value)**
- Alumni from your university currently at target banks
- Friends of friends who work in banking
- Former colleagues or internship connections now in IB
- People you've met at recruiting events who gave you their contact info

**Tier 2: Semi-warm connections (moderate response rate, high value)**
- Alumni from your university at banks you haven't directly connected with
- Members of shared organizations (same fraternity, club, sports team)
- LinkedIn connections through mutual contacts who can introduce you
- People who attended the same program, conference, or competition

**Tier 3: Cold connections (low response rate, still valuable)**
- Alumni from your university you have no mutual connections with
- People at target banks with shared backgrounds (same hometown, same major, same industry experience)
- Professionals you've researched who seem approachable based on their content or profile

**Tier 4: Pure cold outreach (lowest response rate, but still worth doing)**
- Anyone at a target bank, regardless of shared background
- People you found through LinkedIn searches with no obvious connection to you
- Contacts at banks where you have exhausted warmer options

**Important:** These tiers describe response rate likelihood, not whether you should reach out. A 10% response rate on pure cold emails still yields conversations. Don't limit yourself to people you share a connection with—prioritize warm outreach, but reach out broadly.

### Prioritizing Within Banks

Within each target bank, reach out in this order:

**1. Analysts (1st and 2nd year)**

Analysts are closest to the recruiting process and most likely to remember what it was like. They have the bandwidth to take calls and often want to help candidates who remind them of themselves. Start here.

**2. Associates (1st and 2nd year)**

Associates are slightly more removed from recruiting but still accessible. They can provide perspective on the analyst experience and what differentiates strong candidates. They may also have more influence in hiring discussions.

**3. Senior associates and VPs**

These contacts are harder to reach but valuable for understanding group culture and long-term career trajectories. They're less likely to respond to cold outreach but may engage if you have a warm connection.

**4. MDs and senior bankers**

Don't cold email MDs unless you have a direct connection. Their time is extremely limited, and unsolicited outreach from candidates is rarely welcomed. If you have a warm introduction, these conversations can be valuable—but they're not necessary for recruiting success.

### How to Find Contacts

**LinkedIn**
- Search by company, filter by your university
- Look at "People also viewed" for additional contacts
- Check who liked or commented on company posts

**University alumni databases**
- Most schools maintain searchable alumni directories
- Filter by company, graduation year, and location
- Some schools have dedicated finance or banking alumni networks

**Your school's career services**
- May have lists of alumni who've agreed to be contacted
- Can sometimes make warm introductions on your behalf

**Personal network mapping**
- Ask friends, family, and classmates if they know anyone in banking
- Check LinkedIn for mutual connections you hadn't considered
- Former employers may have employees who moved into banking

### Building Your Target List

Create a spreadsheet with these columns:

| Name | Bank | Title | Connection Type | Email | Status | Last Contact | Notes |
|------|------|-------|-----------------|-------|--------|--------------|-------|
| Jane Smith | Goldman Sachs | Analyst | Alumni (Class of 2023) | jsmith@gs.com | Emailed 10/15 | 10/15 | TMT group, from Chicago |

For each target bank, aim to identify:
- 5-10 potential contacts before you start outreach
- A mix of analysts and associates
- At least 2-3 people with warm or semi-warm connections

### Email Address Formats

Most banks follow predictable formats—either `firstname.lastname@domain` or `firstinitiallastname@domain`. Bulge brackets mostly use `firstname.lastname@`, while many middle market banks use `firstinitiallastname@`. See the Finding and Verifying Emails lesson for the full breakdown by bank.

### What If You Have No Connections?

If your school has limited banking alumni or you lack warm connections:

**1. Expand your definition of connection**
- Same state or region, not just same school
- Same major or area of study
- Similar career switcher background
- Shared interests visible on LinkedIn

**2. Leverage non-alumni warm paths**
- Professors who have industry contacts
- Career services staff who can make introductions
- Other students who've successfully networked and can share their contacts

**3. Start with more accessible firms**
- Middle-market banks often have more responsive cultures
- Regional boutiques may have fewer candidates competing for attention
- Build confidence and references before approaching bulge brackets

**4. Create your own warm connections**
- Attend every recruiting event, info session, and coffee chat your school offers
- Ask thoughtful questions and follow up with speakers afterward
- These interactions transform cold contacts into warm ones

## Key Takeaways

- Prioritize warm connections (alumni, mutual contacts) over cold outreach—but don't limit yourself to warm connections only
- Within banks, start with analysts and associates—they're most accessible and relevant
- Build a tracking spreadsheet with 5-10 contacts per target bank before you begin
- Use predictable email formats and LinkedIn to find contact information
- If you lack connections, expand your definition of commonality, attend every event possible, and still reach out cold—a 10% response rate is better than 0%
