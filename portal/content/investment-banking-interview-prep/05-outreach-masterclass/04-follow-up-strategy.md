# Follow-up Strategy and Timing

## Learning Objectives

- Know when and how to follow up on unanswered emails
- Write follow-up messages that increase response rates without being annoying
- Maintain relationships after initial conversations
- Track your outreach systematically to avoid mistakes

## Written Guide

### Why Follow-Up Matters

Most networking emails don't get responses on the first attempt. This isn't about your email quality—it's just how busy people are. Your message may have arrived during a live deal, gotten buried under 200 other emails, or been read on mobile with the intention to respond later and forgotten.

Following up isn't pushy. It's expected. A single polite follow-up can double your response rate.

### The First Follow-Up

**When to send it:** 5-7 business days after your initial email

**How to structure it:**

Keep your follow-up shorter than your original email. Bump the thread (reply to your original email so they see the context) rather than starting fresh.

**Follow-up template:**

> Hi [First Name],
>
> Just wanted to bump this to the top of your inbox—I know things can get buried. Still happy to work around your schedule if you have 15 minutes in the coming weeks.
>
> Thanks again,
> [Your Name]

**What not to do:**

- Don't restate your entire original email
- Don't add guilt ("I noticed you didn't respond...")
- Don't increase the length or add new asks

### The Second Follow-Up

**When to send it:** 7-10 business days after your first follow-up

**When to skip it:** If you've already followed up twice with no response, move on. Three unanswered emails is the maximum.

**Second follow-up template:**

> Hi [First Name],
>
> Circling back one more time—completely understand if now isn't a good time. If you're too busy, no need to reply. Otherwise, happy to find a time that works.
>
> Best,
> [Your Name]

This message explicitly gives them permission not to respond, which paradoxically often increases responses from people who felt awkward about the silence.

### After the Conversation: Thank You Emails

Every networking call should be followed by a thank-you email within 24 hours. Don't skip this.

**Thank-you email template:**

> Hi [First Name],
>
> Thanks for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciated your perspective on [specific thing they mentioned], and your advice about [specific advice] was especially helpful.
>
> I'll definitely [action item you mentioned or thing you'll do based on their advice]. Thanks again, and I'll keep you posted on how recruiting goes.
>
> Best,
> [Your Name]

**What makes a good thank-you:**

- Reference something specific from the conversation
- Show you were listening by mentioning a concrete takeaway
- Keep it brief—3-4 sentences max
- Send within 24 hours while the conversation is fresh

### Maintaining Relationships Over Time

A single conversation is not a relationship. Relationships require multiple touchpoints over time. Here's how to stay on someone's radar without being annoying:

**Update emails (every 6-8 weeks during recruiting)**

> Hi [First Name],
>
> Wanted to give you a quick update—I just submitted my application to [Bank] and wanted to thank you again for your advice on [topic]. [Optional: brief update on something relevant].
>
> Hope things are going well on your end. Thanks again for your help.
>
> Best,
> [Your Name]

**Milestone updates**

When something significant happens—you get an interview, receive an offer, or make a decision—let people who helped you know:

> Hi [First Name],
>
> Quick update: I just received an offer from [Bank]'s [Group] for this summer. Wanted to thank you for your help during recruiting—our conversation about [specific thing] was a big part of why I targeted this group.
>
> Really appreciate your time. Hope to cross paths at [Bank] this summer.
>
> Best,
> [Your Name]

### What to Do When You Don't Hear Back

After two follow-ups with no response, accept that this contact is not going to engage—at least not now. This is normal and not personal.

**Do not:**
- Send a third follow-up
- Try contacting them through other channels
- Express frustration or disappointment in any message
- Write them off permanently—they may respond to future outreach months later

**Do:**
- Move on to other contacts at the same bank
- Focus your energy on relationships that are developing
- Note in your tracker that you didn't hear back (useful context for future outreach)

### Tracking Your Outreach

Without a system, you'll make mistakes: following up too soon, forgetting to follow up at all, emailing the same person twice, or losing track of who you've spoken with.

**Minimum tracking fields:**

| Name | Bank | Group | Email | Date Sent | Follow-up 1 | Follow-up 2 | Call Scheduled | Call Complete | Notes |
|------|------|-------|-------|-----------|-------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|-------|

**Review your tracker:**
- Daily: Check who needs follow-ups
- Weekly: Review response rates and adjust strategy
- Before each call: Review notes on that person and your previous interactions

**Avoid common tracking mistakes:**

- Emailing someone you already emailed at a different address
- Following up on a thread where they already declined
- Forgetting someone agreed to talk and missing the scheduling window

### Timing Rules Summary

| Action | Timing |
|--------|--------|
| Initial email | Tuesday-Thursday, 7-9 AM or 5-7 PM |
| First follow-up | 5-7 business days after initial |
| Second follow-up | 7-10 business days after first |
| Maximum follow-ups | 2 (stop after that) |
| Thank-you email | Within 24 hours of conversation |
| Update email | Every 6-8 weeks during recruiting |

## Key Takeaways

- Following up is expected, not pushy—one polite follow-up can double your response rate
- Keep follow-ups shorter than your original email and bump the existing thread
- Maximum two follow-ups; after that, move on to other contacts
- Send thank-you emails within 24 hours of every conversation with a specific reference to something discussed
- Maintain relationships with brief update emails every 6-8 weeks during recruiting
- Track everything in a spreadsheet to avoid mistakes and stay organized
