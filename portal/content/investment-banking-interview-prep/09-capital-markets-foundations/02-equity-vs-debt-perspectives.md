## Written Guide

### The Fundamental Choice

Every company that needs capital faces a fundamental choice: issue **debt** or issue **equity**. This decision affects:

- Cost of capital
- Control and ownership
- Financial flexibility
- Risk profile

Understanding both issuer and investor perspectives helps you think through corporate finance decisions.

### Issuer Perspective: Debt

**Advantages of Debt**:

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| Tax Shield | Interest is tax-deductible; dividends are not |
| No Dilution | Existing shareholders maintain ownership |
| Lower Cost | Debt is cheaper than equity (lower required return) |
| Discipline | Mandatory payments force operational efficiency |
| Finite Term | Debt matures and can be refinanced |

**Disadvantages of Debt**:

| Drawback | Explanation |
|----------|-------------|
| Mandatory Payments | Must pay interest regardless of performance |
| Covenants | Restrictions on operations, dividends, further borrowing |
| Bankruptcy Risk | Failure to pay can trigger default |
| Limited Flexibility | Fixed obligations reduce strategic options |
| Refinancing Risk | May not be able to refinance at maturity |

**Best Situations for Debt**:
- Stable, predictable cash flows
- Tangible assets for collateral
- Tax-paying company (benefit from shield)
- Desire to avoid dilution
- Low existing leverage

### Issuer Perspective: Equity

**Advantages of Equity**:

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| No Mandatory Payments | Dividends are discretionary |
| No Maturity | Equity is permanent capital |
| No Covenants | More operational freedom |
| Lower Risk | Can't default on equity |
| Strategic Investors | May bring expertise, relationships |

**Disadvantages of Equity**:

| Drawback | Explanation |
|----------|-------------|
| Dilution | Existing shareholders own less |
| Higher Cost | Investors demand higher returns |
| No Tax Shield | Dividends paid from after-tax income |
| Signaling | May signal overvaluation |
| Loss of Control | New shareholders have voting rights |

**Best Situations for Equity**:
- Early-stage or high-growth companies
- Volatile or uncertain cash flows
- Already highly leveraged
- Financing transformative acquisitions
- Market values equity highly

### The Tax Shield

Debt's tax deductibility is significant. The **tax shield** represents the tax savings from interest expense:

```
Tax Shield = Interest Expense × Tax Rate
```

**Example**:
- $100M debt at 6% = $6M interest expense
- Tax rate = 25%
- Tax Shield = $6M × 25% = $1.5M annual savings

This is why after-tax cost of debt is used in WACC:

```
After-Tax Cost of Debt = Pre-Tax Cost × (1 - Tax Rate) = 6% × 0.75 = 4.5%
```

### Investor Perspective: Debt

**Why Invest in Debt**:

| Motivation | Details |
|------------|---------|
| Predictable Income | Fixed coupon payments |
| Capital Preservation | Principal returned at maturity |
| Seniority | Paid before equity in bankruptcy |
| Lower Volatility | Prices less volatile than equity |
| Diversification | Low correlation with stocks |

**Risks of Debt Investment**:

| Risk | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Credit Risk | Issuer may default |
| Interest Rate Risk | Rising rates reduce bond prices |
| Inflation Risk | Fixed payments lose purchasing power |
| Reinvestment Risk | Coupons reinvested at lower rates |
| Liquidity Risk | Some bonds trade infrequently |

**Who Invests in Debt**:
- Pension funds (matching liabilities)
- Insurance companies (regulatory requirements)
- Retirees (income needs)
- Conservative investors

### Investor Perspective: Equity

**Why Invest in Equity**:

| Motivation | Details |
|------------|---------|
| Growth Potential | Unlimited upside |
| Ownership | Share in company's success |
| Dividend Income | Some stocks pay dividends |
| Inflation Hedge | Earnings and dividends can grow |
| Liquidity | Major stocks trade easily |

**Risks of Equity Investment**:

| Risk | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Market Risk | Prices can decline significantly |
| Business Risk | Company may underperform |
| Volatility | Prices fluctuate more than debt |
| Last in Line | Wiped out in bankruptcy |
| No Guaranteed Return | Dividends can be cut |

**Who Invests in Equity**:
- Growth-oriented investors
- Long-term savers (401(k), IRAs)
- Endowments, foundations
- Venture capital, private equity (private companies)

### Risk-Return Spectrum

Capital sources exist on a risk-return spectrum:

| Instrument | Risk to Investor | Expected Return |
|------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Senior Secured Debt | Lowest | 4-6% |
| Senior Unsecured Debt | Low | 5-7% |
| Subordinated Debt | Medium | 7-10% |
| Mezzanine/Preferred | Medium-High | 10-15% |
| Common Equity | Highest | 15-25%+ |

Higher risk demands higher return. This is why equity is "more expensive" than debt from the issuer's perspective.

### The Pecking Order Theory

Research suggests companies have a **pecking order** of financing preferences:

1. **Internal funds** (retained earnings) — No transaction costs, no information asymmetry
2. **Debt** — Lower information costs than equity, tax-advantaged
3. **Equity** — Last resort, signals potential overvaluation

Companies prefer using cash first, then debt, and issue equity only when necessary.

### Signaling Effects

Financing decisions send signals to the market:

**Equity Issuance**: Often interpreted negatively
- "Management thinks stock is overvalued"
- Stock price often drops on announcement

**Debt Issuance**: Generally neutral to positive
- Shows confidence in cash flow stability
- No dilution for existing shareholders

**Share Repurchase**: Often interpreted positively
- "Management thinks stock is undervalued"
- Returns cash to shareholders

### Convertible Securities: The Hybrid

**Convertible bonds** combine debt and equity features:

- Issue as debt (lower coupon than straight debt)
- Convert to equity at holder's option (conversion price)
- Attractive when stock volatility is high

**From Issuer's View**:
- Lower interest cost than straight debt
- Delayed dilution (only if converted)
- May signal confidence in stock appreciation

**From Investor's View**:
- Downside protection (bond floor)
- Upside participation (equity conversion)
- Lower yield than straight debt

### Practical Example: Funding an Acquisition

A company wants to acquire a target for $1B. Options:

**Option A: All Debt**
- Advantages: No dilution, tax shield
- Risks: High leverage, covenant restrictions, refinancing risk

**Option B: All Equity**
- Advantages: No bankruptcy risk, flexible
- Risks: Significant dilution (say 20% of company)

**Option C: 50/50 Mix**
- Balances benefits and risks
- Moderate dilution, moderate leverage
- Most common approach for large deals

**Decision Factors**:
- Current leverage ratio
- Cash flow stability
- Market conditions (debt vs. equity markets)
- Shareholder preferences
- Rating agency considerations

### Common Interview Questions

**"When should a company issue debt vs. equity?"**

Debt is better when the company has stable cash flows, wants to avoid dilution, and can benefit from the tax shield. Equity is better for high-growth companies with volatile cash flows, or when the company is already highly leveraged. Most companies use a mix based on their optimal capital structure.

**"Why is debt cheaper than equity?"**

Two reasons: (1) Debt has priority in bankruptcy, so investors accept lower returns for lower risk; (2) Interest is tax-deductible while dividends are not, so the after-tax cost of debt is even lower. If debt costs 6% pre-tax and the tax rate is 25%, the after-tax cost is only 4.5%.

**"Why might a company choose equity even though it's more expensive?"**

If the company has volatile cash flows and can't reliably make debt payments. If the company is already highly leveraged and adding debt would risk credit ratings or covenants. If the company wants strategic investors who bring more than just capital. Or if the equity market is particularly receptive (high valuations).
