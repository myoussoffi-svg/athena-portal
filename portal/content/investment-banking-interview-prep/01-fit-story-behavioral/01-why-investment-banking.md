# Why Investment Banking and Tell Me About Yourself

## Learning Objectives

- Explain your interest in investment banking in a way that shows research and genuine motivation
- Construct a concise professional narrative that connects your background to banking
- Anticipate and prepare for follow-up questions that test the depth of your interest
- Distinguish between credible and weak responses to motivation questions

## Written Guide

### Why This Question Matters

"Why investment banking?" and "Tell me about yourself" come up in almost every IB interview. They serve multiple purposes: they let you set the tone, they reveal whether you understand what the job actually involves, and they give interviewers material for follow-up questions. Weak answers signal lack of preparation or unclear thinking. Strong answers show research, self-awareness, and alignment between your background and the role.

### Structuring "Tell Me About Yourself"

This question isn't an invitation to recite your entire resume. It's a request for a concise, coherent narrative—typically 60 to 90 seconds—that explains who you are professionally, what you've done, and why you're sitting in this interview.

A strong structure follows this pattern:

1. **Present context**: Where you are now (school, current role) and your focus
2. **Relevant background**: 1-2 experiences that built skills or interest relevant to banking
3. **Why banking**: A clear, specific reason you're pursuing IB
4. **Why now**: Why this recruiting cycle, this firm, or this opportunity

Avoid starting with "I was born in..." or listing every job you've ever had. Focus on signal, not chronology.

### Why Investment Banking: Building a Credible Answer

Interviewers have heard every generic answer. "I like finance" or "I want to work on deals" aren't sufficient. A credible response shows that you understand what investment banking involves and why that aligns with your skills or interests.

Effective answers often reference:

- **Specific aspects of the work**: Exposure to live transactions, working with senior clients, building financial models under time pressure
- **Skill development**: Analytical rigor, attention to detail, learning across industries
- **Pace and intensity**: Preferring high-stakes, fast-moving environments over slower-paced roles
- **Past experiences that connect**: Prior internships, coursework, or projects that gave you a window into deal work or financial analysis

Weak answers rely on:

- Vague prestige signaling ("It's the best training ground")
- Unclear motivations ("I've always loved finance")
- Lack of research ("I want to work on IPOs" when the group doesn't do IPOs)

### Common Follow-Up Questions and Escalation

Interviewers will test your answer. If you say you're interested in M&A, expect: "What M&A deal have you followed recently?" If you mention learning across industries, expect: "Which industry do you want to cover, and why?"

Your initial answer should be strong enough to withstand these follow-ups. If you can't discuss a recent deal, don't claim market awareness. If you have no opinion on industry coverage, don't emphasize cross-sector learning.

### Common Mistakes

**Being too generic**: Answers that could apply to consulting, private equity, or any finance role signal that you haven't thought carefully about banking specifically.

**Overemphasizing exit opportunities**: Mentioning that banking is a "stepping stone" to private equity or other roles can work, but only if framed carefully. Interviewers want to hire people who want to be there, not people who view the job as a box to check.

**Misrepresenting the role**: Claiming you love "working with people" when the job is often solo Excel work, or saying you want "work-life balance" when banking is known for long hours, signals lack of research.

**Failing to prepare for "Why not consulting?" or "Why not private equity?"**: If your answer could apply to other competitive roles, be ready to explain why banking specifically.
