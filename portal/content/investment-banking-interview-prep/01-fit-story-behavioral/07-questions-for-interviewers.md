- Use the Q&A portion of the interview to gather useful information for decision-making

## Written Guide

### Why "Do You Have Any Questions for Me?" Matters

At the end of most interviews, you'll be asked if you have questions. This isn't a formality. It's an opportunity to show interest, gather information, and leave a strong final impression.

Weak candidates ask generic questions or say they have no questions. Strong candidates ask thoughtful, tailored questions that show they've prepared and care about the role.

### Types of Questions to Prepare

You should prepare 4-6 questions and choose 2-3 based on the interviewer's role and how much time remains. Good questions fall into a few categories:

**Questions about the interviewer's experience**:
- "What's been the most interesting deal you've worked on, and why?"
- "What surprised you most about the transition from analyst to associate?" (for an associate or VP)
- "How would you describe the culture of this group compared to other places you've worked?"

These questions are safe, show genuine interest, and give the interviewer an opportunity to talk about themselves.

**Questions about the role or group**:
- "What does a typical staffing process look like? How are analysts assigned to deals?"
- "What types of deals is the group currently focused on?"
- "How much client interaction do analysts typically have in this group?"

These show that you understand the job and want to know what the day-to-day looks like.

**Questions about development and learning**:
- "What kind of mentorship or training do junior analysts receive?"
- "Are there opportunities to rotate across groups or work on cross-sector deals?"
- "What skills do you think are most important for analysts to develop in their first year?"

These show that you're thinking about growth and learning, which is appropriate for an entry-level role.

**Questions about the firm or market**:
- "How is the firm positioning itself in [specific sector] given recent trends?"
- "What's the group's outlook on deal activity over the next 6-12 months?"

These work well if you have some market knowledge and want to show you're thinking about the bigger picture. Be careful not to ask something you should already know.

### Tailoring Questions to the Interviewer

The best questions depend on who you're speaking with:

**Junior interviewer (analyst or associate)**: Ask about their experience, day-to-day work, staffing, or training. Avoid asking them strategic questions about the firm's direction—they may not have visibility into that.

**Senior interviewer (VP, director, or MD)**: You can ask about the group's focus, deal pipeline, culture, or strategic positioning. Avoid asking overly granular questions about analyst logistics.

**HR or recruiter**: Ask about the recruiting timeline, next steps, or what the bank looks for in candidates. Avoid technical or deal-specific questions.

### What Not to Ask

Certain questions are red flags and should be avoided:

**Questions about compensation or hours upfront**: Asking "What's the salary?" or "How many hours do analysts work?" in a first-round interview signals misaligned priorities. Compensation is standardized across bulge brackets, and you should already know the hours are long.

**Questions you could have answered with basic research**: "What sectors does your group cover?" or "Where are your offices located?" suggests you didn't prepare.

**Yes/no questions**: "Do you like working here?" is lazy. Ask open-ended questions that encourage the interviewer to elaborate.

**Questions that suggest you're not committed**: "Do analysts typically leave after two years?" or "What are the exit opportunities?" can work in some contexts, but be careful. Interviewers want to hire people who want to be there.

### Using Questions Strategically

The Q&A is also an opportunity to gather information that will help you decide between offers. If you're genuinely trying to evaluate firms, ask questions that reveal differences:

- "How would you describe the culture here compared to other banks?"
- "What's the group's approach to staffing? Do analysts get to express preferences?"
- "How much mentorship and feedback do junior bankers typically receive?"

These questions help you learn while still sounding engaged and thoughtful.

### Common Mistakes

**Having no questions**: This suggests disinterest or lack of preparation.

**Asking too many questions**: If the interview is running over time, ask 1-2 concise questions. Respect the interviewer's schedule.

**Asking questions that were already answered**: If the interviewer spent 10 minutes explaining the group's deal focus, don't ask "What kinds of deals does the group work on?"

**Asking overly complex or theoretical questions**: This isn't the time to debate market trends or challenge the interviewer's views. Keep questions respectful and focused on learning.
