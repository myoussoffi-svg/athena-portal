# Synergy Modeling and Contribution Analysis

## Learning Objectives

- Model revenue and cost synergies with realistic phase-in schedules
- Calculate synergies needed to break even on a dilutive deal
- Perform contribution analysis to assess deal fairness
- Understand synergy sources and how to validate estimates

## Written Guide

### Types of Synergies

Synergies are the value created by combining two companies that wouldn't exist if they remained separate.

**Cost Synergies** (more common, more achievable):
- Headcount reduction (redundant roles)
- Facility consolidation
- Procurement leverage (better supplier terms)
- IT systems consolidation
- Shared services (finance, HR, legal)

**Revenue Synergies** (less common, harder to achieve):
- Cross-selling products to each other's customers
- Geographic expansion
- Combined product offerings
- Pricing power from market share

**Financial Synergies**:
- Lower cost of debt (stronger combined credit)
- Tax savings (NOL utilization)
- Working capital optimization

### Synergy Phase-In

Synergies don't appear immediately. Model realistic ramp-up:

**Typical Phase-In Schedule**:

| Synergy Type | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3+ |
|--------------|--------|--------|---------|
| Cost Synergies | 25-50% | 75-100% | 100% |
| Revenue Synergies | 0-25% | 25-50% | 75-100% |

**Why the Difference?**

Cost synergies can be actioned quickly (layoffs, facility closures). Revenue synergies require integration, sales training, and customer adoption—they take longer.

### Modeling Cost Synergies

**Step 1: Identify Sources**

| Category | Target | Acquirer | Combined | Synergy |
|----------|--------|----------|----------|---------|
| Corporate overhead | $50M | $80M | $100M | $30M |
| Sales force | $100M | $150M | $200M | $50M |
| Facilities | $40M | $60M | $70M | $30M |
| Procurement | $200M | $400M | $540M | $60M |
| IT systems | $30M | $50M | $60M | $20M |
| **Total** | | | | **$190M** |

**Step 2: Apply Phase-In**

| | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Full Run-Rate Synergies | $190M | $190M | $190M |
| Phase-In % | 40% | 80% | 100% |
| **Realized Synergies** | **$76M** | **$152M** | **$190M** |

**Step 3: Account for Integration Costs**

Achieving synergies requires investment:

| Cost | Amount | Timing |
|------|--------|--------|
| Severance | $40M | Year 1 |
| Facility closure costs | $20M | Year 1 |
| Systems integration | $30M | Years 1-2 |
| Rebranding | $10M | Year 1 |
| **Total Integration Costs** | **$100M** | |

**Rule of Thumb**: Integration costs often equal 50-100% of Year 1 run-rate synergies.

### Modeling Revenue Synergies

Revenue synergies are harder to quantify. Build from specific initiatives:

**Cross-Selling Analysis**:

| Initiative | Logic | Annual Revenue |
|------------|-------|----------------|
| Sell Target products to Acquirer customers | 5% of Acquirer customers adopt, $10K avg | $25M |
| Sell Acquirer products to Target customers | 3% of Target customers adopt, $15K avg | $15M |
| Combined solution premium | 2% price increase on 50% of combined | $20M |
| **Total Revenue Synergies** | | **$60M** |

Apply margin to get EBIT impact:
- If margin on incremental revenue is 30%
- EBIT synergy = $60M × 30% = $18M

### Synergies Needed to Break Even

A key analysis: how much in synergies are needed to make a dilutive deal neutral?

**Formula**:

```
Pre-Tax Synergies Needed = (Dilution × Pro Forma Shares) / (1 - Tax Rate)
```

**Example**:
- Deal is $0.15 dilutive
- Pro forma shares: 260M
- Tax rate: 25%

```
Total After-Tax Dilution = $0.15 × 260M = $39M
Pre-Tax Synergies Needed = $39M / (1 - 0.25) = $52M
```

The deal needs $52M in annual pre-tax synergies to break even on EPS.

**Is This Achievable?**

Compare to:
- Management's synergy estimate
- Peer transaction synergies (as % of combined EBITDA)
- Specific identified initiatives

If management claims $150M of synergies, and you only need $52M to break even, there's significant cushion.

### Contribution Analysis

**Contribution analysis** compares what each company brings to the combination versus what shareholders receive.

**The Question**: Is the ownership split fair given each company's contribution?

**Key Metrics to Compare**:

| Metric | Acquirer | Target | Acq % | Target % |
|--------|----------|--------|-------|----------|
| Revenue | $5,000M | $1,000M | 83% | 17% |
| EBITDA | $1,200M | $200M | 86% | 14% |
| Net Income | $713M | $90M | 89% | 11% |
| Enterprise Value* | $12,000M | $5,000M | 71% | 29% |

*Pre-deal standalone values

**Ownership Analysis**:

| Shareholders | Shares | Ownership |
|--------------|--------|-----------|
| Acquirer shareholders | 200M | 77% |
| Target shareholders | 60M | 23% |
| **Total** | **260M** | **100%** |

**Interpretation**:

Target shareholders receive 23% of the combined company but contribute:
- 17% of revenue
- 14% of EBITDA
- 11% of net income
- 29% of enterprise value

The target is receiving **more ownership than its earnings contribution** but **less than its value contribution**. This could suggest:
- The premium is reasonable (paying for value, not just earnings)
- Or the acquirer is overpaying (ownership > contribution across most metrics)

### Using Contribution Analysis in Negotiations

**If You're Advising the Target**:
- Emphasize metrics where target contributes more than ownership received
- "We're contributing 17% of revenue but only getting 23% ownership"
- Argue for higher premium or exchange ratio

**If You're Advising the Acquirer**:
- Emphasize metrics where target contributes less than ownership received
- "Target contributes only 11% of net income but gets 23% ownership"
- Argue for lower premium

### Synergy Attribution

Who "owns" the synergies? This affects fairness analysis.

**If synergies attributed to combined company**:
- Neither side "owns" them pre-deal
- Just compare standalone contributions

**If synergies split proportionally**:
- Add synergy value to each side based on contribution
- Then compare ownership to adjusted contributions

**Example**:

$150M of synergies valued at 6× = $900M synergy value

| | Standalone Value | Synergy Share* | Total | % of Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Acquirer | $12,000M | $675M | $12,675M | 74% |
| Target | $5,000M | $225M | $5,225M | 26% |

*Attributed 75%/25% based on EBITDA contribution

Target contributes 26% of value including synergies but receives 23% ownership—slightly favorable to acquirer.

### Sensitivity: Synergies vs. Accretion

Build a sensitivity table showing how synergies affect accretion:

| Synergies | Year 1 Accretion | Year 2 Accretion | Year 3 Accretion |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| $0 | (20%) | (18%) | (16%) |
| $75M | (12%) | (8%) | (5%) |
| $150M | (4%) | 2% | 6% |
| $225M | 4% | 12% | 18% |

This shows management and boards how sensitive the deal is to synergy delivery.

### Validating Synergy Estimates

Synergy estimates are often aggressive. Validate by:

**Peer Comparisons**:
- What did similar deals achieve?
- Synergies as % of combined EBITDA (typically 3-10%)

**Bottom-Up Build**:
- Specific initiatives with identified savings
- Headcount × average cost
- Facilities × annual expense

**Management Track Record**:
- Has this management team delivered synergies before?
- How did their estimates compare to actual results?

**Third-Party Validation**:
- Consultant estimates
- Customer/supplier interviews
- Industry expert opinions
