## Learning Objectives

- Explain the purpose and structure of the cash flow statement

- Explain why net income doesn't equal cash flow and how the cash flow statement reconciles the two
- Calculate free cash flow and explain why it matters for valuation

## Written Guide

### Why the Cash Flow Statement Matters in Interviews

The cash flow statement is essential for understanding how a company generates and uses cash. Net income is an accounting measure; cash flow is what actually matters for running the business, paying debt, and funding growth. Interviewers will test your ability to interpret the cash flow statement, calculate free cash flow, and explain why cash flow differs from net income.

The cash flow statement is also the foundation for DCF (discounted cash flow) valuation, which projects future free cash flows and discounts them to present value.

### Purpose of the Cash Flow Statement

The cash flow statement reconciles **net income** (from the income statement) with the **change in cash** (on the balance sheet). It shows:

- How much cash the company generated from operations
- How much cash was invested in the business
- How much cash was raised or returned through financing activities

The three sections—operating, investing, and financing—sum to the **net change in cash**.

### Cash Flow from Operations (CFO)

CFO represents cash generated (or used) by the company's core business activities. It starts with **net income** and adjusts for:

1. **Non-cash expenses**: Items that reduced net income but didn't involve cash, such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation. These are added back.

2. **Changes in working capital**: Differences between accrual-based income and cash flow due to timing of receivables, inventory, and payables.

**Key adjustments**:

- **Depreciation and Amortization (D&A)**: Added back because they're non-cash charges
- **Stock-Based Compensation**: Added back because it's a non-cash expense
- **Increase in Accounts Receivable**: Subtracted (use of cash) because revenue was recognized but cash hasn't been collected
- **Increase in Inventory**: Subtracted (use of cash) because cash was spent to purchase inventory not yet sold
- **Increase in Accounts Payable**: Added (source of cash) because expenses were incurred but not yet paid

**Formula** (simplified):

CFO = Net Income + D&A + Stock-Based Comp - Increase in Receivables - Increase in Inventory + Increase in Payables

CFO is a critical measure of cash generation. A company with strong net income but negative CFO may be growing too fast or collecting cash too slowly.

### Cash Flow from Investing (CFI)

CFI represents cash spent on (or received from) long-term investments. The most common item is **capital expenditures (CapEx)**, which is cash spent on property, plant, and equipment.

**Key items**:

- **CapEx (Purchase of PP&E)**: Negative (use of cash)
- **Proceeds from Asset Sales**: Positive (source of cash) if the company sells equipment or property
- **Acquisitions**: Negative (use of cash) if the company buys another business
- **Investments in Securities or Other Companies**: Negative if purchasing, positive if selling

CFI is typically negative for growing companies, as they invest in infrastructure and growth.

### Cash Flow from Financing (CFF)

CFF represents cash flows related to debt, equity, and dividends. It shows how the company raises capital and returns cash to investors.

**Key items**:

- **Debt Issuance**: Positive (source of cash) when the company borrows
- **Debt Repayment**: Negative (use of cash) when the company repays debt
- **Equity Issuance**: Positive (source of cash) when the company issues stock
- **Share Repurchases (Buybacks)**: Negative (use of cash)
- **Dividends Paid**: Negative (use of cash)

CFF reflects the company's capital structure decisions and capital allocation strategy.

### Net Change in Cash

The sum of CFO, CFI, and CFF equals the **net change in cash**:

Net Change in Cash = CFO + CFI + CFF

This must equal the difference between the cash balance at the beginning and end of the period on the balance sheet. If it doesn't, there's an error.

### Why Net Income Doesn't Equal Cash Flow

Net income is based on accrual accounting, which recognizes revenue when earned and expenses when incurred—not when cash changes hands. The cash flow statement adjusts for:

- **Non-cash expenses** like depreciation
- **Timing differences** in receivables, inventory, and payables
- **Investing and financing activities** that don't appear on the income statement

For example, a company can have high net income but run out of cash if customers are slow to pay (high receivables) or if the company is investing heavily in growth (high CapEx).

### Free Cash Flow (FCF)

**Free Cash Flow** is the cash available to all investors (debt and equity holders) after the company has made necessary investments to maintain and grow the business.

The most common definition is **Unlevered Free Cash Flow (UFCF)**, which is used in DCF valuation:

UFCF = EBIT x (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - CapEx - Increase in NWC

Or, starting from CFO:

UFCF = CFO - CapEx (with adjustments for interest if starting from net income)

**Levered Free Cash Flow (LFCF)** is cash available to equity holders after debt payments:

LFCF = UFCF - Interest Expense x (1 - Tax Rate) + Net Borrowing

For interview purposes, focus on unlevered FCF, as it's most commonly used in valuation.

### Common Mistakes

**Confusing CFO with free cash flow**: CFO includes cash from operations, but free cash flow subtracts CapEx.

**Forgetting to add back non-cash expenses**: Depreciation, amortization, and stock-based comp reduce net income but don't reduce cash, so they must be added back.

**Not understanding working capital changes**: An increase in receivables or inventory uses cash; an increase in payables provides cash. This trips up many candidates.

**Thinking EBITDA is cash flow**: EBITDA is a proxy but doesn't account for working capital changes, CapEx, or taxes. Free cash flow is the true measure.

## Key Takeaways

- The cash flow statement reconciles net income with the change in cash on the balance sheet
- CFO adjusts net income for non-cash items (D&A, stock-based comp) and working capital changes
- CFI includes CapEx, acquisitions, and asset sales; typically negative for growing companies
- CFF includes debt, equity, dividends, and buybacks; reflects capital structure decisions
- Net income doesn't equal cash flow due to accrual accounting, non-cash expenses, and timing differences
- Free cash flow (UFCF) = CFO - CapEx (simplified); it's the cash available for investors and is used in DCF valuation
