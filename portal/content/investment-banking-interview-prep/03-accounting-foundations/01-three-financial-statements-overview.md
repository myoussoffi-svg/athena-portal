### Why the Three Statements Matter in Interviews

The three financial statements—the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement—are foundational to investment banking. You'll be asked to explain them, walk through how they link, and use them to answer valuation and modeling questions. Interviewers expect fluency with these concepts.

A strong understanding of the statements shows that you can read financial information, understand a company's performance, and think through how transactions affect each statement.

### The Income Statement

**Purpose**: The income statement measures a company's profitability over a period of time (e.g., a quarter or year). It shows revenue, expenses, and the resulting profit or loss.

**Key structure**:
- **Revenue** (or sales): Money earned from selling goods or services
- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: Direct costs of producing those goods or services
- **Gross Profit**: Revenue minus COGS
- **Operating Expenses**: Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses, R&D, etc.
- **Operating Income (EBIT)**: Gross profit minus operating expenses
- **Interest and Taxes**: Interest expense on debt and income taxes
- **Net Income**: The bottom line—what's left after all expenses

The income statement is built on the accrual basis of accounting, meaning revenue is recognized when earned (not when cash is received) and expenses when incurred (not when cash is paid). This distinction matters when linking to the cash flow statement.

### The Balance Sheet

**Purpose**: The balance sheet is a snapshot of a company's financial position at a specific point in time. It shows what the company owns (assets), what it owes (liabilities), and what belongs to shareholders (equity).

**Key structure**:
- **Assets**: What the company owns or controls. Divided into current assets (cash, receivables, inventory) and non-current assets (PP&E, intangibles, goodwill).
- **Liabilities**: What the company owes. Divided into current liabilities (payables, short-term debt) and long-term liabilities (long-term debt, deferred taxes).
- **Shareholders' Equity**: The residual value that belongs to shareholders. Includes common stock, retained earnings, and other equity accounts.

The balance sheet is governed by the fundamental accounting equation:

**Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity**

This equation must always balance. If assets increase, either liabilities must increase, equity must increase, or both.

The balance sheet is cumulative. It reflects everything that's happened since the company's inception, not just activity during a single period.

### The Cash Flow Statement

**Purpose**: The cash flow statement reconciles net income (from the income statement) with the actual change in cash. It shows how much cash the company generated or used during a period and where that cash came from or went.

**Key structure**:
- **Cash Flow from Operations (CFO)**: Cash generated from core business activities. Starts with net income and adjusts for non-cash items (like depreciation) and changes in working capital.
- **Cash Flow from Investing (CFI)**: Cash spent on or received from investments, such as buying or selling property, plant, and equipment (CapEx) or acquiring other companies.
- **Cash Flow from Financing (CFF)**: Cash flows related to debt and equity, such as issuing or repaying debt, issuing stock, or paying dividends.

The sum of these three sections equals the net change in cash, which ties to the cash line on the balance sheet.

The cash flow statement is critical because net income doesn't equal cash. A company can be profitable but still run out of cash if, for example, customers are slow to pay or if the company is investing heavily in growth.

### How the Statements Relate

The three statements are interconnected:

- **Net income** from the income statement flows into **retained earnings** on the balance sheet and is the starting point for the cash flow statement.
- **Capital expenditures (CapEx)** on the cash flow statement increase **PP&E** on the balance sheet.
- **Depreciation** on the income statement reduces the value of PP&E on the balance sheet and is added back in the cash flow statement because it's a non-cash expense.
- **Changes in working capital** (receivables, inventory, payables) on the balance sheet affect cash flow from operations.

Understanding these links is essential for interview questions like "Walk me through how the three statements connect" or "If revenue increases by $100, what happens to each statement?"

### Common Mistakes

**Confusing the income statement with cash flow**: Net income isn't the same as cash generated. The income statement is accrual-based; the cash flow statement shows actual cash movements.

**Forgetting the balance sheet balances**: Assets must always equal liabilities plus equity. If you're walking through a transaction and the balance sheet doesn't balance, you've made an error.

**Not understanding what each statement measures**: The income statement measures profitability over time, the balance sheet shows position at a point in time, and the cash flow statement reconciles the two.

**Outline**:
- The purpose of each statement: income statement (profitability), balance sheet (position), cash flow (cash generation)
- Key sections and line items on each statement
- The fundamental accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Equity
- How the statements relate: net income, retained earnings, depreciation, CapEx
- Why interviewers test your knowledge of the three statements

**Suggested Length**: 10 minutes

## Key Takeaways

- The income statement measures profitability over a period; the balance sheet shows financial position at a point in time; the cash flow statement shows cash movements
- The income statement is accrual-based; the cash flow statement reconciles accrual accounting with actual cash
- The balance sheet must always balance: Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity
- The three statements are interconnected: net income flows to retained earnings and the cash flow statement, CapEx affects PP&E, and depreciation links all three
- Fluency with these statements is foundational for modeling, valuation, and technical interview questions
