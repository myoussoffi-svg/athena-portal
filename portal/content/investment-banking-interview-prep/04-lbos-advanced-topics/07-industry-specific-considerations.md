# Industry-Specific Valuation Considerations

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how valuation approaches differ across industries
- Identify industry-specific metrics and multiples (e.g., EV/Subscribers for telecom, P/B for banks)
- Explain why certain industries require adjusted valuation frameworks
- Prepare for questions about valuing non-standard companies (financials, real estate, early-stage)

## Written Guide

### Why Industry Matters in Valuation

While the core valuation methods (DCF, comps, precedent transactions) apply across industries, the **specific metrics, multiples, and assumptions** vary significantly. Interviewers may test whether you understand these nuances, especially if you're recruiting for an industry-focused group (e.g., TMT, healthcare, financial institutions).

Understanding industry-specific considerations shows that you can adapt valuation frameworks to different business models.

### Technology, Media, and Telecom (TMT)

**Common Metrics**:
- **EV/Revenue**: For high-growth, unprofitable companies (SaaS, early-stage tech)
- **EV/EBITDA**: For mature, profitable tech companies
- **EV/Subscribers** or **EV/Users**: For telecom, media, or consumer internet companies
- **Price/Sales**: For software or SaaS companies

**Considerations**:
- **Growth over profitability**: High-growth tech companies may be unprofitable but valued on revenue growth and unit economics
- **Recurring revenue**: SaaS companies are valued on ARR (annual recurring revenue) or MRR (monthly recurring revenue)
- **User metrics**: Social media or consumer internet companies may be valued on DAU (daily active users) or MAU (monthly active users)
- **R&D intensity**: High R&D spend is common and should be normalized when comparing companies

**Example**: A SaaS company with $100M ARR, growing 50% YoY, might trade at 10-15× revenue even if it's unprofitable, because investors value growth and recurring revenue.

### Financial Institutions (Banks, Insurance)

**Common Metrics**:
- **P/B (Price-to-Book)**: Book value of equity is a key metric for banks and insurers
- **P/E (Price-to-Earnings)**: Common for mature financials
- **Price/Tangible Book**: Excludes intangibles like goodwill
- **ROE (Return on Equity)**: Profitability metric specific to financials

**Considerations**:
- **Balance sheet-driven**: Banks and insurers are valued based on their balance sheets (assets, liabilities, equity) rather than EBITDA
- **No EBITDA or EV/EBITDA**: Financial institutions have interest income and expense as core operations, so EBITDA and EV/EBITDA aren't meaningful
- **Regulatory capital**: Banks must maintain minimum capital ratios, which affect their ability to grow or pay dividends
- **Credit quality**: For banks, asset quality (loan losses, NPLs) is critical to valuation

**Example**: A bank trading at 1.2× tangible book value with a 12% ROE is considered fairly valued. A bank with 1.5× P/TBV and 15% ROE would be premium-valued.

### Real Estate (REITs and Real Estate Companies)

**Common Metrics**:
- **P/FFO (Price-to-Funds From Operations)**: FFO is the REIT equivalent of earnings
- **P/AFFO (Price-to-Adjusted Funds From Operations)**: Adjusts FFO for CapEx and other items
- **Dividend Yield**: REITs are required to distribute 90% of taxable income as dividends
- **NAV (Net Asset Value)**: Sum of property values minus debt

**Considerations**:
- **Income-focused**: REITs are valued on their ability to generate and distribute income
- **No depreciation in FFO**: Real estate depreciates for tax purposes, but FFO adds back depreciation because properties often appreciate
- **Property type matters**: Residential, commercial, industrial, and retail REITs have different risk profiles and multiples

**Example**: A retail REIT might trade at 12× FFO, while a data center REIT (higher growth, more defensive) might trade at 20× FFO.

### Healthcare and Pharmaceuticals

**Common Metrics**:
- **EV/EBITDA**: For mature healthcare services or pharma companies
- **EV/Revenue**: For early-stage biotech or medical device companies
- **Pipeline value**: For biotech, value is often based on the probability-adjusted NPV of drug candidates in the pipeline

**Considerations**:
- **Regulatory risk**: FDA approval, clinical trial results, and patent expirations significantly affect valuation
- **Patent cliffs**: When a drug's patent expires, revenue can collapse due to generic competition
- **R&D-heavy**: Biotech companies often have negative EBITDA due to high R&D spend

**Example**: A biotech company with one Phase III drug candidate might be valued based on the probability of approval (e.g., 60%) and the NPV of future cash flows if approved.

---

### Energy and Natural Resources

**Common Metrics**:
- **EV/EBITDA**: For integrated energy companies
- **EV/Production** or **EV/Reserves**: For oil and gas (E&P) companies
- **P/NAV (Price-to-Net Asset Value)**: Sum-of-the-parts valuation based on reserves

**Considerations**:
- **Commodity price sensitivity**: Valuation is highly dependent on oil, gas, or metals prices
- **Reserve life**: E&P companies are valued on their proven reserves and production capacity
- **CapEx intensity**: High CapEx requirements to develop reserves

**Example**: An E&P company might be valued at $50,000 per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) of reserves, depending on oil prices and reserve quality.

---

### Retail and Consumer

**Common Metrics**:
- **EV/EBITDA**: For mature retailers
- **EV/Revenue**: For high-growth e-commerce or direct-to-consumer brands
- **EV/Store** or **Sales per Square Foot**: For brick-and-mortar retailers

**Considerations**:
- **Same-store sales growth**: A key metric for retailers (growth excluding new stores)
- **E-commerce vs. brick-and-mortar**: E-commerce companies may trade at higher multiples due to scalability
- **Inventory management**: Working capital and inventory turnover are critical

**Example**: A premium e-commerce brand growing 40% YoY might trade at 3-5× revenue, while a mature department store might trade at 0.3-0.5× revenue.

---

### Industrials and Manufacturing

**Common Metrics**:
- **EV/EBITDA**: Standard for industrials
- **P/E**: For mature, stable companies
- **EV/Capacity**: For capital-intensive manufacturing (e.g., steel, chemicals)

**Considerations**:
- **Cyclicality**: Industrial companies are often cyclical (tied to economic growth)
- **CapEx and D&A**: High depreciation and CapEx are common
- **Operating leverage**: Margins expand or contract significantly with volume changes

---

### Common Mistakes

**Using the wrong multiple**: Don't use EV/EBITDA for a bank or P/E for a biotech. Understand industry norms.

**Ignoring industry-specific risks**: Regulatory risk (healthcare), commodity prices (energy), and credit quality (financials) are critical.

**Not adjusting for one-time items**: Normalize EBITDA or earnings for non-recurring items, especially in cyclical industries.

**Comparing across industries without context**: A 15× P/E for a tech company means something different than 15× P/E for a utility.

**Outline**:
- Why valuation approaches differ across industries
- TMT: EV/Revenue, EV/Subscribers, growth over profitability
- Financials: P/B, P/TBV, ROE (no EBITDA)
- Real estate: P/FFO, dividend yield, NAV
- Healthcare: Pipeline value, regulatory risk, R&D
- Energy: EV/Reserves, commodity price sensitivity
- Retail and industrials: same-store sales, cyclicality
- Common mistakes and how to adapt frameworks

**Suggested Length**: 10 minutes

## Key Takeaways

- Valuation approaches and multiples vary significantly across industries
- TMT: Use EV/Revenue for growth companies, EV/EBITDA for mature tech
- Financials: Use P/B or P/TBV; EBITDA isn't applicable
- Real estate: Use P/FFO, dividend yield, and NAV
- Healthcare: Account for regulatory risk, pipeline value, and R&D intensity
- Energy: Use EV/Reserves or EV/Production; sensitive to commodity prices
- Always adjust for industry-specific risks and norms when valuing companies
