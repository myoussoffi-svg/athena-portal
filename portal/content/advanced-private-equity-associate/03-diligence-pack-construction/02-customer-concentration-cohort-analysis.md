title: Customer Concentration & Cohort Analysis That Actually Predicts Churn
module: Diligence Pack Construction
lesson: 02
---

## The deal decision this lesson supports
Whether customer concentration and retention risk are truly bounded — or whether one bad renewal cycle can break the base case.

---

## Why IC distrusts most concentration slides
Static concentration hides economic concentration, behavioral churn, and timing asymmetry.

---

## Measure concentration where risk shows up
Start with gross profit, roll customers to parent entities, and assess correlation and cash timing.

---

## Economic concentration vs cosmetic dispersion
Diversified revenue can still mask correlated downside.

---

## Cohort analysis that predicts behavior
Cohorts must show revenue, gross profit, pricing, expansion/contraction, and renewal behavior.

---

## Retention vs pricing power
Gross profit retention reveals whether pricing power is real.

---

## Worked examples
Sticky-but-weak pricing, hidden gross profit concentration, and front-loaded churn all require downside re-underwriting.

---

## Translate concentration into downside math
Explicit churn scenarios and thresholds matter more than averages.

---

## Common failure modes
- Using revenue instead of gross profit
- Showing cohorts without conclusions
- Ignoring correlated churn
- Assuming churn is linear

---

## Sharp synthesis
1) Who are the top customers by gross profit?
2) How correlated is their behavior?
3) Where does retention mask pricing weakness?
4) How fast does churn hit cash and EBITDA?
5) What churn scenario breaks the deal?
