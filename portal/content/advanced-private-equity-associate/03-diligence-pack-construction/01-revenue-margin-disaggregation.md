title: Revenue & Margin Disaggregation That Survives IC Scrutiny
module: Diligence Pack Construction
lesson: 01
---

## The deal decision this lesson supports
Whether the IC believes your revenue and margin assumptions are real — and whether downside cases are actually bounded.

---

## The core mistake associates make
Most diligence packs disaggregate accounting, not economics. IC cares where margin comes from, who pays it, and how repeatable it is.

---

## The only three questions IC is asking
1) Who is actually paying us?
2) Why are they paying us?
3) What causes margin to expand or collapse?

---

## Disaggregate revenue by economic driver
Cut revenue by customer (parent-level), product/service, contracted vs discretionary, new vs existing, price vs volume vs mix, and one-time vs repeatable — only where it affects underwriting risk.

---

## Identify the real margin engine
Margins come from specific combinations of customer, product, pricing, and delivery model. Find which segments subsidize others and which are fragile.

---

## Build a deal-grade margin bridge
Isolate pricing actions, mix shift, volume/utilization, input costs, lag effects, and underinvestment effects. Normalize what reverses first.

---

## Worked examples
Margin expansion from lag, hidden concentration, and pro-cyclical mix all require normalization in underwriting.

---

## Accounting vs economic margin
Ask what it really costs to deliver the next unit and what breaks when volume slows.

---

## Common failure modes
Too many cuts, confusing lag with excellence, and letting totals hide fragility.

---

## Sharp synthesis
1) Which segments generate economic profit?
2) Which are fragile?
3) What margin is durable?
4) What happens in a downturn?
5) What margin would you defend in IC?
