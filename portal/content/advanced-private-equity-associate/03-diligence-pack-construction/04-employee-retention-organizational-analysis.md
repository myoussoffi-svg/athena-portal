module: Diligence Pack Construction
lesson: 04

## The deal decision this lesson supports
Whether the operating model is transferable post-close — or whether EBITDA depends on people you do not control.

---

## Why IC is skeptical of org charts
Titles hide control; headcount hides capability.

---

## Identify value-critical roles
Focus on roles that control pricing, scheduling, collections, quality, or compliance.

---

## Map knowledge concentration
Assess whether knowledge is documented, backed up, and replaceable within a reasonable timeframe.

---

## Retention through economic leverage
Employee retention risk rises with customer control, pricing authority, and undocumented processes.

---

## Worked examples
Founder dependency, ops manager bottlenecks, and rep-driven customer retention all require underwriting response.

---

## Translate people risk into deal mechanics
Retention bonuses, earnouts, transition plans, margin normalization, or walking are valid responses.

---

## Common failure modes
Over-relying on HR metrics, ignoring single points of failure, and flagging risk without action.

---

## Sharp synthesis
1) Which roles are value-critical?
2) Where is knowledge concentrated?
3) What financial risk does attrition create?
4) What mitigation is realistic?
5) What dependency is unacceptable?
