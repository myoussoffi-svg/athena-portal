# KPI Selection & Interpretation

## Outcomes
- Select KPIs that actually matter for underwriting and IC.
- Avoid vanity metrics and misleading averages.
- Translate KPI movement into implications for growth, margin, and risk.

## Agenda
- Understand what IC expects from KPIs.
- Choose KPIs based on decision relevance, not availability.
- Interpret trends, levels, and variability correctly.
- Connect KPIs directly to underwriting assumptions and diligence follow-ups.

## Why this matters in a real deal
Most diligence packs include too many KPIs — and still miss the ones that matter. IC is not impressed by volume. They are looking for clarity: which metrics explain performance, which predict outcomes, and which introduce risk.

Weak KPI selection leads to false confidence. Strong KPI interpretation exposes fragility early, when it can still be addressed.

## Deliverable
- Build a KPI section that:
  - Identifies 6–10 core metrics tied directly to the thesis.
  - Explains *why* each KPI matters and what “good” looks like.
  - Interprets trends, volatility, and inflection points.
- End with 3–5 implications for underwriting or additional diligence.

## Checklist
- [ ] Each KPI maps to a specific growth, margin, or risk assumption.
- [ ] Metrics are defined consistently and clearly.
- [ ] Trends are explained, not just shown.
- [ ] Variability and outliers are addressed explicitly.
- [ ] KPI insights lead to concrete follow-up questions.

## 1) Start with the decision, not the metric
Do not ask, “What KPIs do we have?”  
Ask, “What must be true for this deal to work?”

Typical decision areas include:
- Revenue durability
- Pricing power
- Customer retention
- Operating leverage
- Scalability constraints

KPIs exist to test these ideas. Any metric that does not inform a decision should be deprioritized.

---

## 2) Choose KPIs that explain performance, not just describe it
Strong KPIs do at least one of the following:
- Explain historical performance
- Predict future outcomes
- Reveal underlying risk

Examples:
- Revenue growth is descriptive.
- Net revenue retention explains growth quality.
- Gross margin by cohort explains scalability and pricing power.

Prefer metrics that *decompose* performance over those that simply summarize it.

---

## 3) Limit the core KPI set aggressively
IC attention is finite.

As a rule:
- 6–10 core KPIs is sufficient for most businesses.
- Additional metrics should support or explain the core set, not compete with it.

If you cannot explain why a KPI is included in one sentence, it should not be core.

---

## 4) Interpret levels, trends, and variability
Never show a KPI without interpretation.

For each metric, address:
- **Level:** Is the absolute value strong or weak relative to peers?
- **Trend:** Is it improving, deteriorating, or stable?
- **Variability:** How volatile is it across time, customers, or segments?

Variability often matters more than averages. Stable mediocrity can be preferable to volatile excellence.

---

## 5) Segment KPIs where decisions differ
Aggregates hide risk.

Where relevant, segment by:
- Customer size or cohort
- Product or service line
- Geography
- Channel or end market

Segmentation should answer a question:
- Where does performance break?
- Where does it scale?
- Where is risk concentrated?

Do not segment for completeness — segment to isolate drivers.

---

## 6) Tie KPIs directly to underwriting assumptions
Every key assumption should be supported by metrics.

Examples:
- Growth assumptions ↔ cohort expansion, win rates, pipeline conversion
- Margin assumptions ↔ gross margin trends, labor efficiency, utilization
- Retention assumptions ↔ churn, renewal rates, customer tenure

Make the linkage explicit. IC should not have to infer why a metric matters.

---

## 7) Identify what the KPIs do *not* tell you
Strong analysis acknowledges gaps.

Call out:
- Metrics that are missing or unreliable
- Time periods that are distorted (one-time events, acquisitions)
- Areas where data quality limits conclusions

Then specify how you would validate:
- additional cuts of data
- customer interviews
- expert calls
- targeted diligence requests

This signals judgment, not weakness.

---

## What IC expects to hear
When discussing KPIs, IC wants clarity, not narration.

Be prepared to answer:
- Which metric matters most — and why?
- What worries you in the data?
- What must improve for the upside case to work?
- What breaks first in a downside scenario?

If you cannot answer these, the KPI work is incomplete.

---

## Synthesis
- Which single KPI would you monitor weekly post-close?
- What metric creates the most downside risk if it deteriorates?
- What additional data would most increase confidence in the numbers?
