module: Diligence Pack Construction
lesson: 03
---

## The deal decision this lesson supports
Whether the IC believes management’s operating story — or views KPIs as window dressing.

---

## Why IC distrusts most KPI dashboards
IC cares about which KPIs break first when the story is wrong, not whether they trend up.

---

## KPI categories
Vanity KPIs describe outcomes, operational KPIs describe process, underwriting KPIs test the thesis.

---

## Select KPIs from the thesis
If a KPI cannot falsify an underwriting claim, cut it.

---

## High-signal underwriting KPIs
Revenue durability, pricing power, margin quality, cash conversion, and execution dependency metrics move before financials.

---

## Worked examples
Strong retention masking pricing weakness, margin inflation from stretch, and cash stress preceding churn all require re-underwriting.

---

## KPI behavior in downturns
Identify which KPIs deteriorate first and which lag reality.

---

## Common failure modes
Too many KPIs, no interpretation, trusting definitions, and ignoring correlation.

---

## Sharp synthesis
1) Which KPIs test the thesis?
2) Which break first?
3) Which mislead?
4) What forces reprice?
5) What do you track post-close?
