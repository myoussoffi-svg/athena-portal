title: Synthesizing Diligence Findings for Investment Teams — IC-Ready Narrative, Not Slides
module: Diligence Pack Construction
lesson: 05
---

## The deal decision this lesson supports
Whether the investment team can clearly articulate conviction, risk, and action — or whether the deal dies in IC because the story is muddled.

---

## The synthesis standard
If IC stopped you after 3 minutes, they should know why the deal works, what could break, what you have done about it, and what you recommend.

---

## The five-part IC narrative
1) How the business really makes money  
2) What must be true  
3) What diligence changed  
4) Where downside concentrates  
5) What we are doing about it

---

## Recommendation paragraph
Every synthesis should end with a clear recommendation tied to valuation, assumptions, risks, and actions.

---

## Common failure modes
Slides without judgment, hidden uncertainty, false balance, and recap instead of decision framing.

---

## Sharp synthesis
1) Why does this business make money?
2) What must be true?
3) What changed?
4) What breaks first?
5) What do we recommend?
