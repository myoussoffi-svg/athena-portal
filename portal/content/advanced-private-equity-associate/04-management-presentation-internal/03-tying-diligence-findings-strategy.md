title: Mapping Management Answers to Underwriting Claims — Updating Conviction, Not Taking Notes
module: Management Presentation & Internal Check-In
lesson: 03
---

## The deal decision this lesson supports
Whether management’s answers materially strengthen or weaken the underwriting thesis.

---

## Claims are the unit of analysis
Management’s answers are inputs — underwriting claims are the decisions we need to make. After the meeting, we need to map each answer back to a claim to see how it changed our thinking.

---

## Claim state after the meeting
After the meeting, every claim should have a status: either strengthened, confirmed, weakened, or left unresolved. If you can’t map an answer to a claim, it’s a missed opportunity.

---

## How to map answers
Filter answers through the lens of:
- **Dependency**: Does the answer rely on a key person or team?
- **Process**: Is it a system that can be scaled or a one-off event?
- **Stress-testing**: Can this hold up under tougher conditions?

---

## Worked examples
- **Pricing power**: Often weakens once you reveal customer dependency.
- **Scalability**: Can look great on paper but break when you uncover process bottlenecks.
- **Retention**: Real retention often weakens when dependency on key accounts is exposed.

---

## Conviction scale
For each claim, decide if it’s:
- **High**: Fully confirmed
- **Medium**: Some uncertainty but manageable
- **Low**: Uncertain or doesn’t hold up
- **Invalidated**: The claim is no longer true

---

## Common failure modes
- Mistaking eloquence for proof
- Not updating assumptions after hearing answers
- Avoiding negative conclusions because you want the deal to work

## Sharp synthesis
1. Which claim changed the most after the meeting?
2. What dependency became clear?
3. What assumptions are now in place?
4. What restored your conviction?
5. What changed in the deal after the meeting?
