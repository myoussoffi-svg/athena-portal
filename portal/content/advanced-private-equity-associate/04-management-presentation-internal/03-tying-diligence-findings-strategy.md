title: Mapping Management Answers to Underwriting Claims — Updating Conviction, Not Taking Notes
module: Management Presentation & Internal Check-In
lesson: 03
---

## The deal decision this lesson supports
Whether management’s answers materially strengthen or weaken the underwriting thesis.

---

## Claims are the unit of analysis
Answers are inputs; claims drive decisions.

---

## Claim state after the meeting
Each claim must be strengthened, confirmed, weakened, or left unresolved.

---

## How to map answers
Filter answers through dependency, process, and stress-testing.

---

## Worked examples
Pricing power, scalability, and retention often weaken when dependency is revealed.

---

## Conviction scale
High, medium, low, or invalidated — be explicit.

---

## Common failure modes
Mistaking eloquence for proof, not updating assumptions, and avoiding negative conclusions.

---

## Sharp synthesis
1) Which claim changed most?
2) What dependency emerged?
3) What is now assumed?
4) What restores conviction?
5) What changed in the deal?
