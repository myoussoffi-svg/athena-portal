title: Drafting the Internal Check-In Memo — What Partners Actually Read
module: Management Presentation & Internal Check-In
lesson: 04
---

## The deal decision this lesson supports
Whether partners can accurately update conviction mid-process — or misread risk due to unclear signal.

---

## What the internal memo is
A decision-support document that updates conviction and sets expectations.

---

## Required structure
Executive takeaway, what changed, open risks with actions, implications, and what comes next.

---

## Tone and credibility
Be concise, directional, and explicit. Confidence does not require certainty.

---

## Common failure modes
Reporting without judgment, burying the lede, over-hedging, and avoiding pricing implications.

---

## Sharp synthesis
1) What matters most right now?
2) What changed conviction?
3) What risk is being priced?
4) What is assumed?
5) What decision comes next?
