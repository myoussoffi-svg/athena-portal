title: Drafting the Internal Check-In Memo — What Partners Actually Read
module: Management Presentation & Internal Check-In
lesson: 04
---

## The deal decision this lesson supports
Whether partners can accurately update conviction mid-process — or misread risk due to unclear signal.

---

## What the internal memo is
The internal memo is your way of updating conviction. It’s a concise document that tells the partners what’s changed, where the risks are, and what comes next.

---

## Required structure
1. **Executive takeaway**: What’s the bottom line?
2. **What changed**: What new information has come to light?
3. **Open risks**: What issues are still unresolved, and what’s the action plan?
4. **What’s next**: Where do we go from here?

---

## Tone and credibility
Be concise and explicit. Confidence doesn’t require certainty, but it does require clarity. Don’t hedge; instead, show how you’re addressing the uncertainty.

---

## Common failure modes
- Reporting without judgment
- Burying the lede
- Over-hedging and making the memo too cautious
- Avoiding pricing implications or difficult conclusions

---

## Sharp synthesis
1. What matters most right now?
2. What changed your conviction?
3. What risk is being priced in?
4. What assumptions are in place?
5. What’s the next decision?
