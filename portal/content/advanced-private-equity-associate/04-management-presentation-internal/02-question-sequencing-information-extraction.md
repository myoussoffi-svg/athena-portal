title: Question Sequencing & Information Extraction — Forcing Truth Without Confrontation
module: Management Presentation & Internal Check-In
lesson: 02
---

## The deal decision this lesson supports
Whether management’s answers actually resolve underwriting risk — or merely sound credible.

---

## Why most questioning fails
Good questions asked in the wrong order often produce well-polished, but low-signal answers. You need the right sequencing to get useful information.

---

## Sequence creates pressure
Truth comes out through logical reconciliation, not through confrontation. The order of your questions sets the pace and forces meaningful answers.

---

## The four-phase sequencing model
1. **Narrative**: Get them talking.
2. **Constraints**: Start probing the limits of their assumptions.
3. **Reconciliation**: Push them to explain inconsistencies.
4. **Consequences**: Test the implications of their answers.

## Apply sequencing to underwriting claims
Pricing, margins, retention, and scalability need to be tested using the right order of questions. When you sequence well, the answers will map directly to the deal assumptions.

---

## Advanced extraction techniques
- Silence: Don’t be afraid to let pauses linger.
- Repetition: Ask the same question in different ways to expose inconsistencies.
- Re-framing: Rewording can make people reconsider their answers.

---

## Common failure modes
- Asking too early, before you’ve established the right context
- Debating the answers instead of just letting them sit
- Filling uncomfortable silences with your own words
- Treating answers as facts before validating them

## Sharp synthesis
1. What answer changed after you pressed for more?
2. Where did judgment override the process?
3. What claim weakened?
4. What constraint emerged?
5. What would you do differently next time?
