title: Question Sequencing & Information Extraction — Forcing Truth Without Confrontation
module: Management Presentation & Internal Check-In
lesson: 02
---

## The deal decision this lesson supports
Whether management’s answers actually resolve underwriting risk — or merely sound credible.

---

## Why most questioning fails
Good questions asked in the wrong order produce polished but low-signal answers.

---

## Sequence creates pressure
Truth emerges from logical reconciliation, not confrontation.

---

## The four-phase sequencing model
Narrative → Constraints → Reconciliation → Consequences.

---

## Apply sequencing to underwriting claims
Pricing, margins, retention, and scalability must be tested through order and framing.

---

## Advanced extraction techniques
Silence, repetition, and re-framing expose inconsistency.

---

## Common failure modes
Asking too early, debating answers, filling silence, and treating answers as facts.

---

## Sharp synthesis
1) What answer changed?
2) Where did judgment override process?
3) What claim weakened?
4) What constraint emerged?
5) What would you change next time?
