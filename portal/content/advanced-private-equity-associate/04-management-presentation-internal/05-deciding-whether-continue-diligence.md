title: Deciding Whether to Continue Diligence — Recommit or Kill the Deal
module: Management Presentation & Internal Check-In
lesson: 05
---

## The deal decision this lesson supports
Whether it is rational to spend more time, money, or credibility on this deal — or whether the correct action is to pause, reprice, restructure, or walk.

---

## Continuing diligence is a decision
Every additional workstream increases sunk cost and bias.

---

## The only valid reasons to continue
Resolve a binary uncertainty, quantify a bounded downside, or prepare to structure.

---

## Invalid reasons
Momentum, effort already spent, or finishing the checklist.

---

## Binary vs bounded vs unbounded risk
Binary resolves or kills; bounded reprices; unbounded walks.

---

## Pre-commitment discipline
“If X is true, we do Y.” Write it before proceeding.

---

## Common failure modes
Drift, hedging, process for process’ sake, optimism disguised as diligence.

---

## Sharp synthesis
1) Best reason to stop?
2) What must be true to proceed?
3) Can we know in time?
4) What if negative?
5) Are we acting like owners?
