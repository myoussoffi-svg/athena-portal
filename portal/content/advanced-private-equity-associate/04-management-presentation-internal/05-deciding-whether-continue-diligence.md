title: Deciding Whether to Continue Diligence — Recommit or Kill the Deal
module: Management Presentation & Internal Check-In
lesson: 05
---

## The deal decision this lesson supports
Whether it’s rational to spend more time, money, or credibility on this deal — or whether the correct action is to pause, reprice, restructure, or walk.

---

## Continuing diligence is a decision
Each additional workstream adds cost and bias. Make sure continuing makes sense before you proceed.

---

## The only valid reasons to continue
1. Resolve a binary uncertainty (either yes or no).
2. Quantify a bounded downside (knowable, limited risk).
3. Prepare to structure (have a path to a good deal).

---

## Invalid reasons
Momentum or effort already spent should never be the reason to keep going. Don’t finish the checklist just for the sake of it.

---

## Binary vs bounded vs unbounded risk
- **Binary**: Resolve or kill
- **Bounded**: Reprice and adjust terms
- **Unbounded**: Walk away

---

## Pre-commitment discipline
Before diving into further workstreams, write down what conditions must be true for the deal to proceed. This makes sure you’re not just gathering more data for the sake of it.

---

## Common failure modes
- Drift, process for process’s sake, and optimism disguised as diligence.

---

## Sharp synthesis
1. **Best reason to stop?**
2. **What must be true to proceed?**
3. **Can we know in time?**
4. **What if negative?**
5. **Are we acting like owners?**
