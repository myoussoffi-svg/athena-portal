title: Designing the Management Presentation to Extract Truth (Not Answers)
module: Management Presentation & Internal Check-In
lesson: 01
---

## The deal decision this lesson supports
Whether the management meeting increases conviction — or merely increases comfort.

---

## The real purpose of the management presentation
The objective is constraint revelation, not fact gathering.

---

## Design around underwriting claims
Every section must pressure-test a specific deal assumption.

---

## Ask for process, not outcomes
Processes expose control, incentives, and fragility.

---

## Force tradeoffs
Tradeoffs reveal priorities and bottlenecks.

---

## Separate story from operating reality
Revisit topics from multiple angles to surface inconsistency.

---

## Control order, not tone
Sequence creates pressure without aggression.

---

## Common failure modes
Validation bias, ceding control, mistaking comfort for conviction, and saving hard questions for last.

---

## Sharp synthesis
1) What claim weakened?
2) Where did consistency break?
3) What relied on people not systems?
4) What constraint emerged?
5) What would you redesign?
