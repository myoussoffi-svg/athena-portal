title: Designing the Management Presentation to Extract Truth (Not Answers)
module: Management Presentation & Internal Check-In
lesson: 01
---

## The deal decision this lesson supports
Whether the management meeting increases conviction — or merely increases comfort.

---

## The real purpose of the management presentation
The objective here is not fact-gathering, but **constraint revelation**. We want to identify where the deal assumptions break down, not just confirm everything we already believe.

---

## Design around underwriting claims
Every part of the presentation should be aimed at challenging a specific underwriting claim. If it doesn’t put pressure on a key assumption, it’s not adding value.

---

## Ask for process, not outcomes
The answers don’t matter as much as the process that led to them. Processes expose the company’s control over its future, its incentives, and its weaknesses.

---

## Force tradeoffs
Tradeoffs are where the real decisions happen. They reveal the company’s priorities and its bottlenecks. If we aren’t seeing them, we’re not learning enough.

---

## Separate story from operating reality
By revisiting the same topics from different angles, you’ll spot inconsistencies that could tell you something is off.

---

## Control order, not tone
You don’t need to be aggressive to get the truth. The way you sequence questions creates pressure and guides the conversation without confrontation.

---

## Common failure modes
- Validation bias (confirming your own assumptions)
- Ceding control of the conversation
- Mistaking comfort for conviction
- Leaving tough questions for the end of the meeting

## Sharp synthesis
1. What claim weakened?
2. Where did consistency break down?
3. What relied on people, not systems?
4. What constraint emerged?
5. What would you redesign next time?
