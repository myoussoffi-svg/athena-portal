title: Designing the 100-Day Plan
module: Post-Close & 100-Day Ownership Mindset
lesson: 02
---

## The deal decision this lesson supports
The first 100 days post-close set the trajectory for the entire investment. This lesson focuses on how associates help translate the investment thesis into a concrete, executable 100-day plan that prioritizes value creation, risk control, and management alignment.

## Key takeaways:
1. **Purpose of the 100-Day Plan:**
   The 100-day plan is not a wish list. It is a focused execution roadmap that answers:
   - What must be done immediately to protect downside?
   - What initiatives validate the underwriting early?
   - What decisions cannot wait six months?

2. **Anchoring the Plan to the IC Thesis:**
   Every major initiative in the plan should tie directly back to the IC memo:
   - Core value creation levers
   - Key risks identified during diligence
   - Assumptions that require early validation

3. **What Belongs in the First 100 Days (and What Doesn’t):**
   Appropriate 100-day initiatives typically include:
   - Pricing, customer concentration, or margin diagnostics
   - Management capability assessment
   - KPI reporting build-out
   - Early commercial or operational quick wins

   What does *not* belong:
   - Long-term transformation projects
   - Major systems overhauls
   - Initiatives without a clear owner

4. **Structuring the Plan:**
   Strong 100-day plans are:
   - Time-bound (30 / 60 / 90-day milestones)
   - Owner-specific (management vs sponsor vs advisor)
   - Outcome-driven (decisions and actions, not activities)

5. **Associate Responsibilities:**
   Associates are responsible for:
   - Translating thesis into initiatives
   - Pressure-testing feasibility with management
   - Tracking progress and surfacing slippage early

---

## Common failure modes:
- **Overloading the plan:** Too many initiatives dilute accountability
- **Generic plans:** Recycling templates instead of tailoring to the deal
- **Lack of ownership:** No clear decision-maker per initiative

---

## Sharp synthesis:
1. Which thesis assumptions must be validated within 100 days?
2. What actions most directly protect downside early?
3. Where is management likely to resist change?
4. What initiatives require sponsor involvement vs management ownership?
5. How would you know by Day 90 if the plan is working?
