title: Early Warning Signals & Course Correction
module: Post-Close & 100-Day Ownership Mindset
lesson: 05

## The deal decision this lesson supports
The difference between a good deal and a bad outcome is often how early problems are identified and addressed. This lesson focuses on recognizing early warning signals post-close and taking decisive corrective action before value erosion accelerates.

## Key takeaways:
1. **Why Early Signals Matter More Than Big Misses:**
   Deals rarely fail overnight. They fail through:
   - Small misses that go unaddressed
   - Rationalizations that delay action
   - Overconfidence in the original thesis

   Associates are closest to the data and are often the first to see issues forming.

2. **Common Early Warning Signals:**
   Signals that merit attention include:
   - KPIs consistently missing internal targets (even if close)
   - Management explanations changing month to month
   - Delayed decisions or repeated “next quarter” answers
   - Increased focus on external excuses (market, customers, macro)
   - Data quality deteriorating instead of improving

3. **Separating Noise from Signal:**
   Not every miss requires intervention. Associates must ask:
   - Is this a one-time variance or a trend?
   - Does this impact a core thesis assumption?
   - Is management aware and acting decisively?

4. **Executing Course Correction:**
   Effective course correction involves:
   - Clearly diagnosing the root issue
   - Resetting expectations and timelines
   - Adding resources, changing scope, or escalating accountability
   - Documenting changes so drift is visible

5. **Associate Responsibilities:**
   Associates are expected to:
   - Surface uncomfortable truths early
   - Push for action when momentum slows
   - Avoid optimism bias driven by sunk costs

## Common failure modes:
- **Normalizing underperformance:** Treating misses as “temporary”
- **Waiting for perfect data:** Delaying action until certainty is impossible
- **Protecting relationships over outcomes:** Avoiding conflict at the expense of value

## Sharp synthesis:
1. Which early signals would most concern you on this deal?
2. What evidence would justify immediate intervention?
3. How would you distinguish a learning curve from structural weakness?
4. When does course correction become management change?
5. How would you document and communicate a reset to IC or the board?
