module: Post-Close & 100-Day Ownership Mindset
lesson: 03
---

## The deal decision this lesson supports
Once ownership begins, the firm needs visibility and control. This lesson focuses on how associates help establish the right KPIs and operating cadence to monitor performance, surface issues early, and reinforce accountability.

## Key takeaways:
1. **Why KPIs Matter Post-Close:**
   KPIs are not reporting artifacts — they are decision tools. The goal is to quickly identify:
   - Where performance is deviating from underwriting
   - Which value creation levers are working (or not)
   - Where management attention should be focused

2. **Selecting the Right KPIs:**
   Effective KPI sets are:
   - **Thesis-driven:** Directly tied to the IC case
   - **Actionable:** Management can influence them
   - **Leading where possible:** Not just lagging financials

   Typical early post-close KPIs include:
   - Revenue by segment / customer
   - Gross margin and contribution margin
   - Backlog, bookings, or pipeline conversion
   - Headcount, utilization, or capacity metrics
   - Cash flow and working capital drivers

3. **Avoiding KPI Bloat:**
   More KPIs do not equal more insight. Associates should push for:
   - A short “core” dashboard reviewed weekly
   - A secondary set reviewed monthly
   - Clear thresholds that trigger escalation

4. **Establishing Operating Rhythm:**
   Operating rhythm refers to the cadence of:
   - Weekly management check-ins
   - Monthly performance reviews
   - Quarterly board-level discussions

   Consistency matters more than format. The objective is early signal detection, not perfect reporting.

5. **Associate Responsibilities:**
   Associates are responsible for:
   - Translating diligence metrics into live reporting
   - Ensuring data integrity early
   - Calling out gaps, inconsistencies, or excuses

---

## Common failure modes:
- **Lagging-only metrics:** Waiting for financials to reveal problems
- **Inconsistent reporting:** Changing definitions month to month
- **Passive review:** Looking at numbers without driving action

## Sharp synthesis:
1. Which KPIs most directly validate or disprove the investment thesis?
2. What early indicators would signal underperformance?
3. Which metrics require judgment rather than mechanical review?
4. Where is management most likely to game the numbers?
5. What escalation triggers should be agreed upfront?
