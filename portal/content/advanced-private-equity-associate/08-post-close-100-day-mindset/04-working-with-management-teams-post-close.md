title: Working with Management Teams Post-Close
module: Post-Close & 100-Day Ownership Mindset
lesson: 04
---

## The deal decision this lesson supports
Post-close value creation depends heavily on how effectively the sponsor works with management. This lesson focuses on how associates help manage that relationship, balance support with accountability, and surface issues early without undermining trust.

---

## Key takeaways:
1. **The Relationship Reset After Close:**
   Pre-close, management is selling a vision. Post-close, they are executing against commitments. The dynamic shifts from persuasion to accountability, and associates must help enforce that shift professionally.

2. **Establishing Clear Roles and Expectations:**
   Early clarity matters:
   - What decisions management owns vs. sponsor-owned decisions
   - What requires board approval
   - What information must be surfaced proactively

   Ambiguity here creates friction and delays execution.

3. **Balancing Support and Pressure:**
   Strong sponsor-management relationships combine:
   - Tactical support (resources, advisors, capital)
   - Clear expectations (timelines, targets, consequences)

   Associates often play the role of translator — turning sponsor expectations into executable actions for management.

4. **Reading the Management Team:**
   Early signals matter:
   - Who is proactive vs. reactive?
   - Who owns problems vs. deflects?
   - Who was strong in diligence but struggles in execution?

   These observations inform whether talent upgrades may be needed.

5. **Escalation Without Erosion of Trust:**
   Not every issue is a board-level problem. Associates must:
   - Differentiate noise from signal
   - Escalate patterns, not one-offs
   - Bring problems with proposed solutions, not just concerns

## Common failure modes:
- **Becoming a messenger:** Relaying information without judgment or synthesis
- **Over-accommodating management:** Allowing slippage under the guise of partnership
- **Premature escalation:** Undermining management credibility over minor issues

## Sharp synthesis:
1. Which management commitments from diligence matter most now?
2. Where is management most likely to under-deliver?
3. What behaviors signal execution risk vs. learning curve?
4. When should an issue be handled quietly vs. escalated?
5. How would you course-correct without damaging trust?
