title: Shifting from Deal Execution to Ownership
module: Post-Close & 100-Day Ownership Mindset
lesson: 01
---

## The deal decision this lesson supports
Once a deal closes, the associate’s role fundamentally changes. This lesson focuses on the mindset shift from transaction execution to ownership, and how early post-close behavior sets the tone for long-term value creation.

## Key takeaways:
1. **The Ownership Mindset Shift:**
   Pre-close, the goal is to get comfortable enough to proceed. Post-close, the firm owns every outcome. Associates must shift from identifying risk to actively managing it, and from modeling value to delivering it.

2. **What Changes on Day One:**
   After close, priorities shift quickly:
   - No more hypothetical scenarios — only real execution
   - Management credibility matters more than presentation polish
   - Small issues compound quickly if not addressed early

3. **Your Role as an Associate Post-Close:**
   Associates are no longer just supporting diligence. They become:
   - The connective tissue between deal team, operating partners, and management
   - The keeper of the original investment thesis
   - The early-warning system when reality diverges from plan

4. **Protecting the Investment Thesis:**
   The original IC thesis should not be forgotten after close. Associates must continuously ask:
   - Are we executing the value creation levers we underwrote?
   - Are new risks emerging that were not priced in?
   - Do early results validate or contradict our assumptions?

5. **Common Early Post-Close Traps:**
   - Over-indexing on reporting instead of action
   - Letting management “settle in” too long before pushing priorities
   - Failing to escalate issues because they seem small

## Common failure modes:
- **Staying in deal mode too long:** Continuing to think like a banker instead of an owner
- **Losing sight of the thesis:** Not tying post-close actions back to IC commitments
- **Delayed intervention:** Waiting for quarterly reviews instead of acting early

## Sharp synthesis:
1. What aspects of the investment thesis are most fragile in the first 100 days?
2. Where is management most likely to under-execute relative to underwriting?
3. What early indicators would tell you the deal is drifting off plan?
4. Which issues must be addressed immediately vs. monitored over time?
5. How would you explain the deal’s priorities to management in one page?
