## Key takeaways:
1. **Performance Tracking and Metrics:**
   Associates should regularly monitor key metrics to assess whether the portfolio company is achieving its financial and operational goals. Key metrics often include:
   - **Financial performance:** Revenue, EBITDA, profitability, working capital management.
   - **Operational performance:** Efficiency, supply chain effectiveness, production output, customer satisfaction.
   - **Strategic progress:** Market share, product innovation, customer base growth.

2. **Conducting Performance Reviews:**
   Associates should conduct regular performance reviews to track progress against targets and identify areas that need attention. This could include monthly or quarterly reviews with senior management and key stakeholders to ensure alignment.

3. **Identifying and Addressing Strategic Gaps:**
   If performance metrics are lagging or there are emerging threats to the business, associates need to be proactive in identifying strategic gaps. This may require adjusting the company's growth strategy, market positioning, or operations.

4. **Adjusting Strategy:**
   When performance deviates from the plan, associates should be ready to recommend strategy adjustments. This could involve rethinking pricing models, exploring new customer segments, or shifting focus to new product lines. Timely adjustments are key to keeping the portfolio company aligned with its goals.

5. **What’s expected from associates:**
   Associates are expected to stay closely involved in performance monitoring and make strategic recommendations when necessary. They should use data to guide decisions and act quickly to address any issues that arise.
