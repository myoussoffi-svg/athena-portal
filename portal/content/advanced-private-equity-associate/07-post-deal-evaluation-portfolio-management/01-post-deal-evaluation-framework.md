## The deal decision this lesson supports
After a deal is closed, it’s crucial to evaluate its success or identify areas where adjustments are needed. This lesson provides an overview of the post-deal evaluation framework that associates can use to assess whether the investment is meeting its targets.

## Key takeaways:
1. **Post-Deal Evaluation Purpose:**
   Post-deal evaluation serves to measure whether the anticipated value creation is being achieved and to identify corrective actions if necessary. Associates should track both financial and operational performance metrics to ensure that the portfolio company is on track.

2. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
   Effective post-deal evaluation relies on monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs) to gauge the performance of the portfolio company. Typical KPIs include:
   - **Financial Metrics:** Revenue growth, EBITDA margin, ROI, and cash flow.
   - **Operational Metrics:** Market share, customer satisfaction, employee turnover, and product innovation.
   - **Strategic Metrics:** Alignment with long-term strategic goals, market position, and scalability.

3. **Benchmarking and Comparison:**
   Benchmarking against industry standards or comparable companies can provide context for the portfolio company’s performance. Associating internal projections with actual results will highlight areas of success and where the company may need additional support.

4. **Corrective Actions:**
   When performance doesn’t meet expectations, associates must be proactive in identifying corrective actions. This may involve operational improvements, changes in management, or rethinking the business strategy to realign the company with its goals.

5. **What’s expected from associates:**
   Associates should be able to evaluate the ongoing performance of portfolio companies, comparing them to initial targets and benchmarks, and recommending corrective actions. They are also expected to provide regular reports to senior leadership and offer recommendations on strategic decisions.

## Common failure modes:
- **Overlooking non-financial performance:** Focusing solely on financial metrics can overlook operational or strategic issues that impact long-term success.
- **Inconsistent tracking:** Failing to track KPIs regularly or inconsistently reporting results can prevent timely corrective actions.
- **Inaction on underperformance:** Not identifying or addressing underperformance in a timely manner can erode the value of the investment.
