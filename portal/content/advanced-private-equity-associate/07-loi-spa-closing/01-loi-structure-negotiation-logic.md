# LOI Structure Negotiation Logic

## Outcomes
- Build a work product you could share internally.
- Identify the decisions and risks this work supports.
- Execute a repeatable workflow under time pressure.

## Agenda
- Define the objective and decision context.
- Gather the minimum inputs needed.
- Analyze and pressure-test assumptions.
- Translate findings into implications and next steps.

## Why this matters in a real deal
This work determines whether the deal narrative survives scrutiny. Done well, it improves decision quality and surfaces risk early. Done poorly, it creates false confidence and wastes diligence time.

## Deliverable
- Produce a 1–2 page output (memo, outline, or analysis) that is decision-relevant and defensible.

## Checklist
- [ ] Scope and definitions are explicit.
- [ ] Key assumptions are stated and testable.
- [ ] Downside risks are identified and prioritized.
- [ ] Findings translate into underwriting implications.
- [ ] Next diligence actions are clear.
## Learning Objectives

- Explain the purpose and structure of a Letter of Intent (LOI) in PE transactions
- Evaluate which LOI terms are critical negotiation points versus standard provisions
- Develop frameworks for structuring exclusivity, breakup fees, and expense reimbursement provisions
- Diagnose when to push for favorable terms versus accept seller positions to maintain deal momentum
- Structure LOI drafting and review processes that protect buyer interests while maintaining seller relationships
- Defend LOI terms when VPs challenge proposed language or sellers request changes

## Written Guide

### What is an LOI and Why It Matters

The LOI (or Letter of Intent, sometimes called Term Sheet) is a non-binding agreement that outlines the key economic and structural terms of a proposed acquisition.

**Purpose**:
- Establish purchase price and valuation methodology
- Grant buyer exclusivity to complete diligence
- Outline deal structure (asset vs. stock, rollover equity, earnouts)
- Set timeline to signing and closing
- Allocate deal expenses

**Binding vs. non-binding**:
- Most LOI provisions are **non-binding** (price, structure, timing)
- Certain provisions are **binding**: Exclusivity, confidentiality, expense allocation, governing law

### Standard LOI Structure

**1. Purchase price and valuation**
- Enterprise value or equity value
- Valuation methodology (e.g., 10.0× LTM EBITDA)
- Subject to working capital and net debt adjustments

**2. Transaction structure**
- Asset purchase vs. stock purchase
- Rollover equity (if any)
- Earnout or deferred consideration

**3. Exclusivity period**
- Typically 60–90 days
- Seller cannot solicit or negotiate with other buyers

**4. Conditions to closing**
- Satisfactory completion of due diligence
- No material adverse change (MAC)
- Financing commitment (if applicable)
- Regulatory approvals

**5. Timeline**
- Target date for definitive agreement (SPA) signing
- Target closing date

**6. Expense allocation**
- Who pays for diligence costs (typically buyer pays own costs)
- Breakup fees (rare in PE; more common in public M&A)

**7. Confidentiality and governing law**

### Key Negotiation Points

**1. Purchase price**

Most negotiated term. IC has approved a valuation range; your job is to land within it.

**Negotiation tactics**:
- Anchor at low end of range
- Reference comp multiples or QofE findings as justification for adjustments
- Tie price to performance (e.g., "10.0× LTM EBITDA based on QofE-adjusted figures")

**2. Exclusivity**

**Buyer preference**: Longer exclusivity (90–120 days) to complete diligence without time pressure

**Seller preference**: Shorter exclusivity (30–60 days) to avoid being locked up

**Negotiation**:
- Standard is 60–90 days
- Justify longer exclusivity if: Complex business, regulatory approvals required, extensive third-party diligence
- Offer "carve-outs": Seller can exit exclusivity if buyer fails to deliver financing commitment within X days

**3. Working capital and net debt adjustments**

**Principle**: Buyer should receive the business with normalized levels of cash, debt, and working capital

**LOI language**:
"Purchase price subject to dollar-for-dollar adjustments for working capital variance from $[normalized level] and net debt variance from $[target level]."

**What to watch**:
- Ensure "normalized" working capital is defined (often based on trailing 12-month average)
- Ensure net debt includes debt-like items (deferred revenue, unfunded pensions, etc.)

**4. Deal structure: Asset vs. stock**

Tax advisor will recommend structure. LOI should reflect this.

**If seller resists asset deal**:
- Offer to split the difference on valuation
- Negotiate seller tax gross-up
- Accept stock deal but adjust price downward to account for lack of step-up

**5. Earnouts**

Used when there is uncertainty about future performance or valuation gap.

**LOI earnout language**:
"Additional consideration of up to $[X] payable based on achievement of [revenue/EBITDA] targets over [1–3 years]."

**Associate responsibility**: Ensure earnout structure is clear and measurable. Avoid vague language.

### Binding Provisions: Exclusivity and Expenses

**Exclusivity clause**:

"Seller agrees that for a period of [X] days, Seller will not solicit, entertain, or negotiate with any other potential buyers. Buyer's exclusivity terminates if [specific conditions]."

**Why it is binding**: Protects buyer's diligence investment. Without exclusivity, seller can shop the deal.

**Expense reimbursement**:

Rare in middle-market PE deals, but sometimes buyers request seller reimburse diligence costs if seller backs out.

**Negotiation**:
- Sellers resist this
- Typically only included if seller has history of failed processes

### LOI Review and Approval Process

**Step 1: Deal counsel drafts initial LOI**

Based on VP's guidance on key terms

**Step 2: Associate reviews**

Check for:
- Consistency with IC-approved terms
- Completeness (all material terms addressed)
- Clear definitions (working capital, net debt, EBITDA)

**Step 3: VP and principal review and approve**

**Step 4: Send to seller**

**Step 5: Negotiate revisions**

Seller will push back on price, exclusivity, or other terms. Associate tracks changes and escalates material revisions to VP.

**Step 6: Execution**

Both parties sign

### What to Escalate to Your VP

**Escalate if**:
- Seller requests material price reduction
- Seller refuses exclusivity or requests very short period (<45 days)
- Seller proposes earnout structure that is unmeasurable or manipulable
- Seller insists on asset deal when tax advice recommends stock (or vice versa)

## Key Takeaways

- LOI is a mostly non-binding agreement outlining purchase price, structure, exclusivity, and timeline—certain provisions (exclusivity, confidentiality, expenses, governing law) are binding
- Key negotiation points include purchase price (anchor at low end of IC range), exclusivity period (60–90 days standard), working capital/net debt adjustments, and deal structure (asset vs. stock)
- Exclusivity is binding and protects buyer's diligence investment—justify longer periods with business complexity or regulatory needs, offer carve-outs if seller resists
- Ensure working capital and net debt are defined clearly in the LOI to avoid disputes during closing adjustments
- Associate reviews LOI for consistency with IC terms, completeness, and clear definitions before VP approval and sending to seller
- Escalate material seller pushback (price reductions, short exclusivity, unmeasurable earnouts, structure conflicts) to your VP immediately
