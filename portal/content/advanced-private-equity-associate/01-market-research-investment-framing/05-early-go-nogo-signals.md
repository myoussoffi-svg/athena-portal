# Early Go / No-Go Signals

## Outcomes
- Build a structured early-screen framework: what to validate, what to ignore, and when to stop.
- Identify common false positives and false negatives in early diligence.
- Produce a go/no-go summary that is tight, defensible, and decision-oriented.

## Agenda
- Define the screening objective and timing (Day 1-10).
- Establish "kill criteria" and "confirm criteria."
- Separate evidence from narrative.
- Draft a go/no-go memo with explicit thresholds.

## Why this matters in a real deal
Time is your scarcest resource. Premium investors know when to stop. Associates create value by surfacing disconfirming evidence early, protecting the team from confirmation bias, and forcing clarity: what must be true, what is uncertain, and what breaks the deal.

## Deliverable
- Write a 1-page "Early Go/No-Go Memo" with:
  - 3-5 confirm criteria (what must be true to proceed)
  - 3-5 kill criteria (what ends the deal or forces a reprice)
  - Evidence status (confirmed / not confirmed / contradicted)
  - Next 5 diligence actions with owners and dates

## Checklist
- [ ] Criteria include thresholds, not vague statements.
- [ ] Evidence status is explicit (what we know vs what we think).
- [ ] Disconfirming evidence is surfaced, not buried.
- [ ] Downside case is articulated (what breaks first).
- [ ] Next actions close the highest-impact uncertainties.

## 1) Define the timeframe and decision
Early signals are about:
- Proceed, reprice, or stop
- Not "learn everything"

A practical frame:
- Day 1-3: sanity checks, risk flags, thesis plausibility
- Day 4-10: validate the two biggest value drivers and two biggest risks

---

## 2) Establish confirm criteria (what must be true)
Examples (customize per deal):
- Retention: gross churn < X% in core segment, cohorts stable
- Pricing: realized price increases without offsetting concessions
- Unit economics: contribution margin stable; CAC payback reasonable
- Competitive: win rate supported by real differentiation, not one sales leader
- TAM: growth pathway exists without heroic assumptions

Make criteria measurable.

---

## 3) Establish kill criteria (what ends the deal)
Kill criteria examples:
- Customer concentration: top 1-3 customers represent > Y% and are at risk
- Churn: new cohorts show materially higher churn than legacy
- Margin quality: EBITDA requires underinvestment or non-recurring addbacks
- Growth: recent growth driven by one-time events, not repeatable drivers
- Competitive: competitor consistently wins on outcomes/value, not price

Kill criteria do not have to be absolute. Some are "reprice criteria."

---

## 4) Watch for false positives (common traps)
- "We have contracts" (but renewal is weak and concessions grow)
- "Sticky customers" (but usage is shallow; switching is easy)
- "Great management" (but plan is not tied to inputs and constraints)
- "Market tailwinds" (but company is losing share)
- "Pipeline is strong" (but win rate and cycle time disagree)

A premium associate flags these early and asks for the evidence.

---

## 5) A simple go/no-go evidence table
Use this structure in your memo:

Confirm criteria:
- Criterion 1 | Status (Confirmed / Unknown / Contradicted) | Evidence | Implication
- Criterion 2 | ...

Kill criteria:
- Criterion 1 | Status | Evidence | Implication
- Criterion 2 | ...

This forces professional clarity.

## 6) Translate into a decision recommendation
Your recommendation must include:
- Decision: proceed / pause / reprice / stop
- Rationale: 3 bullets max
- Remaining uncertainties: 3 bullets max
- Next actions: 5 items with owner + timing

Do not hide behind "needs more diligence."

## Synthesis
- What is the single datapoint that would force a stop this week?
- Which assumption is most likely wrong in the downside case?
- If you had 48 hours to validate only one thing, what is it and how would you validate it?
