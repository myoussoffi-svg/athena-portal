# Differentiation Moats

## Outcomes
- Build a work product you could share internally.
- Identify the decisions and risks this work supports.
- Execute a repeatable workflow under time pressure.

## Agenda
- Define the objective and decision context.
- Gather the minimum inputs needed.
- Analyze and pressure-test assumptions.
- Translate findings into implications and next steps.

## Why this matters in a real deal
This work determines whether the deal narrative survives scrutiny. Done well, it improves decision quality and surfaces risk early. Done poorly, it creates false confidence and wastes diligence time.

## Deliverable
- Produce a 1–2 page output (memo, outline, or analysis) that is decision-relevant and defensible.

## Checklist
- [ ] Scope and definitions are explicit.
- [ ] Key assumptions are stated and testable.
- [ ] Downside risks are identified and prioritized.
- [ ] Findings translate into underwriting implications.
- [ ] Next diligence actions are clear.
## Learning Objectives

- Identify sources of sustainable competitive advantage (moats)
- Evaluate the durability and defensibility of differentiation
- Distinguish between real moats and temporary advantages
- Assess how moats translate to pricing power and margin sustainability

## Written Guide

### What Are Moats and Why They Matter

- Definition of economic moats
- How moats protect margins and enable pricing power
- Moats as determinants of long-term value creation

### Types of Moats

- Brand and reputation
- Network effects
- Switching costs and lock-in
- Proprietary technology or intellectual property
- Regulatory barriers or licenses
- Scale advantages and cost position
- Distribution and channel control

### Evaluating Moat Durability

- Testing whether advantages are sustainable over 5-10 years
- Threats from technology, regulation, or market shifts
- Customer willingness to pay for differentiation
- Evidence of moat erosion vs. strengthening

### Differentiation vs. Moats

- Differentiation: what makes the company different today
- Moats: what prevents competitors from replicating that difference
- Examples of differentiation without moats (easily copied)
- Examples of strong moats (high switching costs, network effects)

### Assessing Moat Strength Through Diligence

- Customer interviews: why they chose this company, switching likelihood
- Competitor analysis: can they replicate key advantages?
- Historical pricing and margin trends as evidence of moat strength
- Churn rates and customer retention as moat indicators

### Translating Moats to Valuation

- Strong moats justify premium multiples
- Weak or eroding moats require discounts
- Moats determine margin sustainability and pricing assumptions
- Exit multiples depend on moat durability

**Video Title**: Identifying Differentiation and Moats in Diligence

**Outline**:
- What are moats and why they matter
- Types of moats: brand, network effects, switching costs, scale, IP, distribution
- Evaluating moat durability: sustainability, threats, customer willingness to pay
- Differentiation vs. moats: what's replicable vs. defensible
- Assessing moats through diligence: customer interviews, competitor analysis, pricing trends
- Translating moats to valuation and margin assumptions

**Suggested Length**: 16 minutes

## Key Takeaways

- Moats are sustainable competitive advantages that protect margins and enable pricing power
- Key moat types: brand, network effects, switching costs, IP, scale, distribution, regulatory
- Evaluate durability by testing sustainability over 5-10 years and threats from competitors/technology
- Differentiation (what makes the company different) is not the same as moats (what prevents replication)
- Assess moats through customer interviews, competitor analysis, pricing trends, and churn rates
- Strong moats justify premium valuation; weak moats require discounts and conservative assumptions

## Synthesis
- What would change your mind based on new data?
- What breaks first in a downside case?
- What is the single highest-leverage next diligence action?
