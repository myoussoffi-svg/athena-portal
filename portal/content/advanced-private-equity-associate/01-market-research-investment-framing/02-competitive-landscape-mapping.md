# Competitive Landscape Mapping

## Outcomes
- Build a clean, decision-oriented map of competitors that holds up in IC.
- Distinguish real competitors from noise, adjacency, and false comps.
- Translate competitive structure into implications for growth, pricing, and exit.

## Agenda
- Define the competitive set correctly (and narrowly).
- Segment competitors by strategy, economics, and customer overlap.
- Identify sources of advantage and structural constraints.
- Convert the landscape into underwriting risks and diligence priorities.

## Why this matters in a real deal
Weak competitive analysis leads to weak underwriting. If you misidentify who the company truly competes against, you will misunderstand pricing power, customer churn risk, and margin sustainability. IC does not care how many logos you collected — they care whether you correctly identified the players that determine outcomes.

This work directly affects valuation, growth assumptions, and the credibility of the investment thesis. Competitive landscape errors tend to surface late, when they are expensive to fix.

## Deliverable
- Produce a 1–2 page competitive landscape memo with:
  - A clearly defined competitive set (primary, secondary, substitutes).
  - A segmentation of competitors by strategy and economics.
  - A summary of competitive advantages, vulnerabilities, and structural constraints.
- End with 3–5 implications for underwriting and the specific diligence steps required to validate them.

## Checklist
- [ ] Primary competitors are defined by customer overlap and buying decisions, not marketing categories.
- [ ] Competitive segments explain differences in pricing, margins, and go-to-market.
- [ ] You can articulate why certain players are *not* competitors.
- [ ] Competitive dynamics are linked to growth, churn, and margin assumptions.
- [ ] The memo ends with decision-relevant implications, not description.

## 1) Define the competitive set before listing companies
Start by defining *who competes for the same customer decision*.

Ask:
- Who does the customer actively evaluate at the point of purchase?
- What alternatives would win if this company did not exist?
- What internal or “do nothing” options substitute for the product?

### Categorize competitors explicitly
Use three buckets:
- **Primary competitors:** Direct substitutes in the buying decision.
- **Secondary competitors:** Adjacent offerings that win in certain segments or use cases.
- **Substitutes:** Different solutions that solve the same problem another way.

**Rule of thumb:** If a competitor does not influence win/loss outcomes, pricing, or retention, they do not belong in the primary set.

---

## 2) Segment competitors by strategy, not by logo
A strong landscape explains *why* competitors behave differently.

Segment by:
- **Value proposition:** Price-led, feature-led, service-led, integrated.
- **Customer segment:** SMB vs. enterprise, regulated vs. unregulated, local vs. national.
- **Go-to-market:** Direct sales, channel-driven, inbound, bundled.
- **Economic model:** Margin profile, cost structure, scalability.

Avoid generic labels. Each segment should imply:
- different pricing power
- different margin ceilings
- different growth constraints

---

## 3) Identify sources of competitive advantage (and limits)
Do not claim “moats” without evidence.

Evaluate advantages across:
- **Switching costs:** Operational, contractual, behavioral.
- **Differentiation:** Features that matter in purchasing decisions (not marketing claims).
- **Cost advantages:** Scale, procurement, labor, technology.
- **Distribution:** Channels that are difficult to replicate.
- **Regulatory or structural barriers:** Licensing, approvals, fragmentation.

For each claimed advantage, ask:
- How is it earned?
- How durable is it?
- Under what conditions does it break?

---

## 4) Understand competitive dynamics over time
Static landscapes are misleading.

Analyze:
- Are competitors consolidating or fragmenting?
- Are new entrants winning on price or innovation?
- Is competition intensifying as the market matures?
- How does the cycle (economic, regulatory, technological) affect behavior?

This informs:
- sustainability of margins
- feasibility of price increases
- likelihood of competitive responses to growth initiatives

---

## 5) Translate the landscape into underwriting logic
This is the most important step — and the most commonly skipped.

Convert insights into statements like:
- “Pricing growth assumes limited competitive response from Segment X.”
- “Share gains require winning customers from lower-priced incumbents.”
- “Margin expansion depends on moving customers from Segment B to Segment A.”

Then specify validation:
- win/loss analysis
- customer interviews
- churn and cohort data
- competitor pricing intelligence

If you cannot tie competitive analysis to a diligence action, it is incomplete.

---

## What goes into the memo (what IC expects)
Keep this tight and structured.

**Memo outline:**
- One-paragraph market context
- Competitive set definition (primary / secondary / substitutes)
- Segmentation table with key differences
- Summary of advantages and constraints
- 3–5 underwriting implications
- Next diligence step(s)

Avoid exhaustive profiles. Depth matters more than coverage.

---

## Synthesis
- If the strongest competitor drops price by 10%, what breaks in the thesis?
- Which competitor matters most in a downside case, and why?
- What single diligence question would most reduce uncertainty about competitive risk?
