# Anticipating IC Questions Objections

## Outcomes
- Build a work product you could share internally.
- Identify the decisions and risks this work supports.
- Execute a repeatable workflow under time pressure.

## Agenda
- Define the objective and decision context.
- Gather the minimum inputs needed.
- Analyze and pressure-test assumptions.
- Translate findings into implications and next steps.

## Why this matters in a real deal
This work determines whether the deal narrative survives scrutiny. Done well, it improves decision quality and surfaces risk early. Done poorly, it creates false confidence and wastes diligence time.

## Deliverable
- Produce a 1–2 page output (memo, outline, or analysis) that is decision-relevant and defensible.

## Checklist
- [ ] Scope and definitions are explicit.
- [ ] Key assumptions are stated and testable.
- [ ] Downside risks are identified and prioritized.
- [ ] Findings translate into underwriting implications.
- [ ] Next diligence actions are clear.
## Learning Objectives

- Explain how to anticipate standard and deal-specific IC questions based on thesis, risks, and diligence findings
- Evaluate which questions signal genuine concern versus routine diligence and prioritize preparation accordingly
- Develop frameworks for preparing concise, data-driven answers that address IC member perspectives
- Diagnose when IC questions indicate lack of conviction versus desire for additional detail
- Structure Q&A preparation documents and mock IC sessions that stress-test presentation readiness
- Defend answers under pressure when IC members probe assumptions, challenge data, or express skepticism

## Written Guide

### Why Question Anticipation is Critical

IC meetings are high-pressure. Your VP will be asked difficult questions. If they cannot answer confidently, IC will:
- Lose confidence in the deal team
- Request additional work
- Pass on the deal

**Associates' role**: Anticipate every possible question and prepare answers.

### Standard IC Questions (Asked on Every Deal)

**1. "Why is this a good deal?"**

Translation: Restate the thesis clearly and concisely.

**Prepared answer**: "We are acquiring a founder-owned SaaS business with best-in-class retention that is under-monetized. We will expand margins through pricing optimization and achieve 3.0× MOIC in 4 years."

**2. "What is the key risk?"**

Translation: What could go wrong?

**Prepared answer**: "Customer concentration. Top customer is 30% of revenue. If they churn, EBITDA declines $10M. We are mitigating through retention efforts and escrow. Downside case assumes churn and still achieves 2.0× MOIC."

**3. "Why are we paying this price?"**

Translation: Justify the valuation.

**Prepared answer**: "We are paying 11× EBITDA, which is a premium to comps (9–10×). However, target has 35% EBITDA margin vs. 22% comp average. On EV/Revenue, we are in line at 4.0×."

**4. "What if the base case does not work?"**

Translation: Show me the downside.

**Prepared answer**: "In downside case, we assume revenue growth slows to 5%, margins compress to 22%, and exit at 9×. We still achieve 2.0× MOIC, which meets our hurdle."

**5. "Why us? Why now?"**

Translation: Why are we differentiated, and why is this the right time?

**Prepared answer**: "Founder is seeking liquidity after 15 years. We have operating partners with SaaS scaling expertise. Market is consolidating; this is a platform for buy-and-build."

### Deal-Specific Questions Based on Risks

For each key risk, anticipate follow-up questions:

**Risk**: Customer concentration

**Anticipated questions**:
- "What is the contract term with the top customer?"
- "Have you spoken to them?"
- "What happens if they demand a price reduction?"
- "Can we get an escrow for revenue clawback?"

**Risk**: Management retention

**Anticipated questions**:
- "Is the CEO staying?"
- "What happens if the CFO leaves?"
- "Do we have retention agreements?"
- "Is there a succession plan?"

**Risk**: Revenue quality

**Anticipated questions**:
- "Is the revenue recurring or one-time?"
- "What did QofE say about revenue recognition?"
- "How confident are we in the forward pipeline?"

**Risk**: Competitive dynamics

**Anticipated questions**:
- "Who are the competitors?"
- "Why do customers choose this company over competitors?"
- "What prevents a larger player from entering this space?"

### Preparing Answers: Data, Not Opinions

**Weak answer**:
"Management says the relationship with the top customer is strong."

**Strong answer**:
"Top customer has been with the company for 8 years. Average contract value has grown from $2M to $5M over that period. Contract renews in 6 months. CFO spoke with the customer's procurement lead last week; no indication of issues. We are proposing early renewal discussions in Q1."

**Why strong answer works**: Specific data (tenure, revenue growth, renewal timing, recent contact).

### Mock IC: Practice Under Pressure

**Two weeks before IC**, conduct a mock IC session:

**1. Assemble internal team**: VP, principal, associate, and 1–2 colleagues to play IC members

**2. Present the full IC deck** as if it were real IC

**3. Role-play challenging questions**:
- Assign roles: One person plays skeptical partner, another plays detail-oriented partner
- Ask every difficult question you can think of

**4. Debrief**:
- Which questions were handled well?
- Which were stumbling points?
- What additional prep is needed?

**5. Refine answers** and update Q&A document

### Handling "I Don't Know" at IC

Sometimes you genuinely do not know the answer. IC will respect honesty over BS.

**Bad response**:
Guess or make up an answer.

**Good response**:
"I do not have that data in front of me. I can follow up post-IC with the specific detail."

**Better response** (if you have backup materials):
"I do not recall off the top of my head, but we have that analysis in the backup materials. Let me pull it up." [Retrieve appendix slide.]

**Best response** (if you anticipated the question):
"Great question. Per the QofE report, the answer is [specific data]. We also modeled sensitivity to this assumption, shown on slide 32."

### Recognizing When IC is Skeptical vs. Curious

**Skeptical signals**:
- Multiple partners ask variants of the same question (suggests shared concern)
- Questions focus on risks and downside, not upside
- Body language: Partners leaning back, arms crossed, lack of engagement

**Curious signals**:
- Questions are clarifying, not challenging ("Can you walk through how you calculated this?")
- Partners engage with the thesis ("If we execute the pricing initiative, could we achieve even higher margins?")
- Positive body language: Leaning in, taking notes

**If IC is skeptical**:
- Acknowledge concerns directly: "I understand this risk is material. Here is how we are addressing it."
- Do not become defensive
- Offer to do additional work if needed

**If IC is curious**:
- Lean into the engagement
- Provide additional detail
- Show optionality and upside

### After IC: Tracking Follow-Ups

IC may approve with follow-up items or request additional work.

**Associate responsibility**:
- Take detailed notes on every question and follow-up request
- Within 24 hours, circulate summary:
  - Questions asked
  - Answers provided
  - Follow-up items and owners
  - Timeline for completion

**If IC requests more work**:
- Clarify exactly what is needed
- Assign responsibilities
- Set timeline for returning to IC

- Preparing data-driven answers (14:00–18:00)
- Conducting mock IC sessions (18:00–22:00)
- Handling "I don't know" and recognizing skepticism vs. curiosity (22:00–27:00)

**Suggested Length**: 30 minutes

## Key Takeaways

- Anticipate standard IC questions (Why is this a good deal? What is the key risk? Why this price? What if base case fails? Why us, why now?) and prepare concise, thesis-aligned answers
- For each key risk, anticipate specific follow-up questions and prepare data-driven responses with supporting evidence (contract terms, customer conversations, QofE findings)
- Prepare answers with data, not opinions—cite specific sources (QofE, management, customer interviews, market study) and quantify impacts wherever possible
- Conduct mock IC sessions 1–2 weeks before IC to stress-test presentation, identify weak points, and refine Q&A document
- Handle "I don't know" with honesty and offers to follow up—IC respects transparency over guessing or deflection
- Recognize signals of skepticism (repeated questions on risks, defensive body language) vs. curiosity (clarifying questions, engagement with upside) and adjust tone accordingly
- Track all follow-ups after IC and circulate summary within 24 hours with questions, answers, action items, owners, and timelines

## Synthesis
- What would change your mind based on new data?
- What breaks first in a downside case?
- What is the single highest-leverage next diligence action?
