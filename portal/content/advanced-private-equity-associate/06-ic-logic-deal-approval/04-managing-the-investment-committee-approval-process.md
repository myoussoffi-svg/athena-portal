## Key takeaways:
1. **The Role of Timing in the Approval Process:**
   The timing of the IC meeting and follow-up is crucial. You need to ensure that all stakeholders are on board before presenting the proposal. Being mindful of the IC's calendar and ensuring that you’re ready to answer all questions will significantly affect your chances of approval.

2. **Effective Communication Strategies:**
   Communication with the IC is a critical factor in securing approval. Be clear and concise in your presentation and provide all the necessary information without overwhelming the committee. Follow up with a summary after the presentation and be sure to answer any lingering questions promptly.

3. **Managing IC Feedback and Adjustments:**
   After the presentation, the IC may provide feedback and request adjustments. How you manage this feedback is key to securing approval. Be open to making changes but ensure that any revisions don’t undermine the core value of the deal.

4. **Building Consensus Among Committee Members:**
   The IC is often composed of individuals with different perspectives. Building consensus requires addressing each member’s concerns while presenting a unified proposal. Engage each committee member individually, if possible, before the official meeting to understand their concerns and align your arguments.

5. **What’s expected from associates:**
   Associates are expected to manage the entire approval process, from setting up meetings to handling follow-up questions. They should be proactive in communicating with the IC, managing any feedback, and guiding the deal through the approval process efficiently.

## Common failure modes:
- **Rushing the approval process:** Hurrying to close the deal without fully addressing concerns can backfire.
- **Inadequate follow-up:** Not answering questions or providing updates after the presentation can erode trust.
- **Ignoring dissenting opinions:** Failing to address concerns from committee members can result in delays or rejection.
