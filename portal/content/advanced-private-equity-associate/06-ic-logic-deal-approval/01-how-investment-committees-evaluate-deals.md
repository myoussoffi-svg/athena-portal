module: IC Logic & Deal Approval
lesson: 01

## The deal decision this lesson supports
Understanding how the investment committee evaluates a deal is crucial for presenting a compelling investment case. This lesson focuses on the IC’s framework for decision-making and how associates can use that to craft more persuasive, credible proposals.

## Key takeaways:
1. **What’s the IC’s role?**
   The investment committee is the ultimate decision-maker, and their role is to evaluate risk, reward, and fit for the firm’s overall strategy. It’s not about convincing them the deal is perfect, but about showing them that the risks are manageable and the potential returns are justified.

2. **What does the IC care about?**
   The IC cares about upside, downside, and potential mitigating actions. They’re looking for clear evidence that the deal is structured correctly, that risks are mitigated, and that the return assumptions hold up under scrutiny.

3. **The framework ICs use:**
   When presenting to the IC, it’s important to frame your case in terms of market dynamics, competitive advantages, and risk mitigation. Here’s the IC’s evaluation framework:
   - **Investment Thesis:** Why does this deal make sense?
   - **Risk Mitigation:** What risks are being taken and how are they being addressed?
   - **Return Assumptions:** How do the return assumptions hold up in different scenarios?
   - **Deal Structure:** Is the deal structured in a way that protects downside and maximizes upside?

4. **What’s expected from associates:**
   Associates are expected to build a coherent, well-supported argument that ties all of the above into a clear and actionable recommendation. The committee’s role is to challenge your assumptions, not just accept them.

## Common failure modes:
- **Overloading the IC with data**: More isn’t always better. Focus on what matters.
- **Ignoring the downside**: Only presenting the upside can make your case seem unrealistic.
- **Weak mitigation strategies**: ICs need to know how risks will be dealt with.

## Sharp synthesis:
1. What’s the most compelling part of the deal from the IC’s perspective?
2. Where do you expect the IC to push back?
3. What risk has the biggest potential impact on returns?
4. What assumptions would you expect the IC to challenge?
5. What’s your backup plan if the deal structure doesn’t pass muster with the IC?
