## The deal decision this lesson supports
Once the investment committee has reviewed your proposal, the next step is to defend your recommendations and assumptions. This lesson will guide you on how to confidently address concerns, answer tough questions, and handle objections in a way that strengthens your case.

## Key takeaways:
1. **Anticipating IC Questions:**
   Before the meeting, prepare for potential pushback. Review your assumptions and the deal structure from the IC’s perspective. Common questions often revolve around:
   - **Assumption validity:** How realistic are your growth and return assumptions?
   - **Risk mitigations:** How credible are your proposed mitigation strategies?
   - **Strategic fit:** How does this deal truly align with the firm’s strategic goals?

2. **Handling Tough Questions:**
   When responding to questions, maintain confidence, but be honest if you don’t have an immediate answer. It’s more important to show that you’ve thoroughly considered the issue and can provide a reasoned, data-backed response. If you don’t have an answer, commit to getting back with additional data if necessary.

3. **Framing Risk Mitigation Effectively:**
   The IC is always concerned about risk. Be ready to explain how each potential risk will be mitigated. Provide contingency plans and stress test your assumptions under different scenarios.

4. **How to Handle Objections:**
   If there’s strong resistance, don’t get defensive. Instead, acknowledge the concern, show that you’ve considered it, and offer your mitigation strategy. Be open to modifying your proposal where necessary, but stand firm on critical elements that you believe are key to the deal’s success.

5. **What’s expected from associates:**
   Associates are expected to not only present a compelling proposal but also defend it when challenged. This includes being prepared to back up their assumptions, provide alternative perspectives, and stay calm under pressure.

## Common failure modes:
- **Avoiding tough questions:** Dodging difficult topics will only raise more doubts.
- **Getting defensive:** A defensive attitude can undermine your credibility.
- **Weak risk mitigation responses:** Be prepared to explain your strategies clearly and confidently.
