module: IC Logic & Deal Approval
lesson: 05

## The deal decision this lesson supports
Once the investment committee has approved the deal, the next crucial step is implementing a post-approval action plan. This lesson focuses on what associates need to do to ensure that the deal progresses smoothly after approval and transitions from the planning phase to execution.

## Key takeaways:
1. **The Importance of a Transition Plan:**
   After IC approval, associates need to prepare for the transition from deal negotiation to execution. A well-structured action plan is essential for ensuring that the deal stays on track. This includes finalizing any remaining terms, coordinating with operational teams, and aligning with key stakeholders.

2. **Managing Stakeholder Expectations:**
   Post-approval, associates need to keep key stakeholders (internal teams, external advisors, and the portfolio company) aligned with the deal’s strategic objectives. This includes maintaining clear communication and setting realistic expectations about timelines, key milestones, and resource allocation.

3. **Monitoring and Reporting Progress:**
   Once the deal is in execution, associates should continue to monitor progress against key performance indicators (KPIs). This includes tracking operational and financial performance and ensuring that the portfolio company is on track to meet its goals. Regular reporting to the IC and other stakeholders is necessary to maintain visibility and manage any emerging risks.

4. **Addressing Emerging Risks:**
   Risks do not end once the deal is approved. In fact, post-approval may present new risks, such as integration challenges, market shifts, or unforeseen operational issues. Associates need to be proactive in identifying these risks early and coordinating with relevant teams to mitigate them effectively.

5. **What’s expected from associates:**
   Associates are expected to play an active role in the execution phase, from transitioning the deal into operational hands to monitoring progress and reporting back to the IC. They must demonstrate strong project management skills and an ability to handle unexpected challenges as they arise.

## Common failure modes:
- **Lack of communication:** Not keeping all stakeholders informed can lead to confusion and missed milestones.
- **Underestimating integration challenges:** Failing to plan for integration or post-deal challenges can cause operational disruptions.
- **Poor performance tracking:** Not tracking the right KPIs or not reporting progress regularly can lead to issues going unnoticed.
