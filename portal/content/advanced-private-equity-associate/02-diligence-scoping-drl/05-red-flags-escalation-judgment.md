title: Red Flags, Escalation, and Judgment — Knowing When to Force the Decision
module: Diligence Scoping & DRL
lesson: 05
---

## The deal decision this lesson supports
Whether you preserve decision integrity when new information threatens the deal — or let momentum, sunk cost, and politeness carry you into a bad signing.

---

## What actually qualifies as a red flag
A red flag is information that breaks an underwriting assumption, forces structural protection, reduces returns below hurdle, creates asymmetric downside, or materially reduces close probability.

---

## The four categories of real red flags
1) Economic misrepresentation  
2) Durability failure  
3) Structural or legal kill-switches  
4) Execution dependency risk

---

## The escalation ladder
- Clarify: targeted follow-up
- Elevate: partner awareness + downside assumption
- Force decision: reprice, restructure, condition, or walk

---

## The escalation frame
1) What we found  
2) Why it matters economically  
3) What must be true  
4) What happens if wrong  
5) Recommendation

---

## Worked examples
Termination-for-convenience contracts, recurring EBITDA addbacks, and working capital traps all require early escalation and explicit action paths.

---

## When walking is the right call
Walk when downside is unbounded, the thesis is disproven, verification relies on trust, or returns only work in a narrow optimistic case.

---

## Pre-commitment discipline
“If X is true, we do Y.” Write this before IC to prevent rationalization.

---

## Sharp synthesis
1) What assumption is most dangerous?
2) What evidence kills it?
3) What is your action if it emerges?
4) Are you escalating early enough?
5) Would you sign unchanged today?
