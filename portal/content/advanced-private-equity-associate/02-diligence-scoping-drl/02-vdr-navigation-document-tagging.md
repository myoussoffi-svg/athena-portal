title: VDR Navigation & Document Tagging That Actually Changes Underwriting
module: Diligence Scoping & DRL
lesson: 03
---

## The deal decision this lesson supports
Whether you can (a) surface deal-breaking facts early, and (b) build a defensible “what we know vs. what we’re assuming” record before IC / LOI / signing. This is not about being organized. It’s about preventing the classic failure mode: **the VDR contained the answer, but the team didn’t realize it until it was too late**.

---

## The VDR is evidence, not a library
Treat the VDR like a case file. Every doc either:
- increases confidence in a critical underwriting claim,
- weakens it and forces a price/structure change, or
- doesn’t matter right now.

---

## Start with underwriting claims, then map documents to claims
Before you browse folders, write 8–12 claims (internal). If you can’t tie a doc to a claim, it’s Phase 3.

---

## The five VDR zones that change deals (and get under-read)
Customer contracts, revenue leakage artifacts, labor reality, claims history, and customer communications are where deals actually break.

---

## A tagging system that forces judgment
Use tags that encode underwriting impact:
- Claim
- Signal (+ / –)
- Severity
- Action
- Owner

---

## The doc → question → test workflow
Document → economic consequence → verification test → pricing/structure action.

---

## Mini-template: Evidence log your VP actually wants
- Evidence
- Finding
- Economic implication
- Decision implication
- Next test + owner + deadline

---

## Sharp synthesis
1) What are the three documents that most threaten the underwriting story?
2) What is the economic consequence of each?
3) What evidence do you need in 72 hours?
4) If you can’t get it, what changes: price, structure, or willingness to close?
