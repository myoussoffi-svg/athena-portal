title: Synthesizing VDR Insights Into Underwriting (Not a “Findings List”)
module: Diligence Scoping & DRL
lesson: 04
---

## The deal decision this lesson supports
Whether you can walk into the next deal team / IC check-in and credibly answer: what changed in conviction, what the new worst-case is, what would force a reprice or walk, and what must be learned in the next 72 hours to keep momentum.

---

## The synthesis standard: “What is true now that wasn’t true before?”
Synthesis is not a document list. It is a statement of what changed in the underwriting:
- What got stronger (and why)
- What got weaker (and why)
- What remains unknowable (and therefore must be priced or structured)

If your update cannot change a decision, it is reporting, not synthesis.

---

## Start with the underwriting map (Claims → Tests → Status)
For each underwriting claim:
- **Status:** Confirmed / Partially confirmed / Unconfirmed / Contradicted
- **Evidence:** 1–2 highest-signal documents (not 12)
- **Implication:** price / structure / timing / close probability
- **Next test:** owner + deadline
- **Escalation:** yes/no and why

IC reads confidence levels, not download volume.

---

## Don’t synthesize “issues.” Synthesize economic consequences
Translate findings into mechanisms:
- **Revenue durability** (retention, switching costs, contract power)
- **Margin quality** (pricing vs mix vs lag vs underinvestment)
- **Cash conversion** (working capital traps, capex reality, billing/collections)
- **Close probability** (consents, litigation, compliance, financing)

A finding that doesn’t map to one of these is usually noise.

---

## The Issue Frame (the only format that matters)
When something is real, frame it like this:

1) **What we saw (fact)**  
2) **Why it matters (economic mechanism)**  
3) **How big it could be (range, not precision)**  
4) **What must be true to neutralize it (verification plan)**  
5) **Action if adverse (reprice / restructure / condition / walk)**  
6) **By when (deadline aligned to deal timeline)**

This is what makes your update “senior”: not certainty, but governance.

---

## Define thresholds and escalation triggers (no vibes)
Examples of decision triggers:
- Any **top-10** customer with **termination for convenience** + no credible switching-cost evidence → escalate immediately
- **MFN / price caps** covering **>25%** of revenue (or present in multiple top contracts) → haircut pricing power; reduce multiple
- Margin expansion explained primarily by **input lag** or **underinvestment** → normalize margins in base case
- Sustained **working capital build** not explained by timing → treat as structural cash trap; reduce leverage / returns
- Repeated **claims/loss patterns** → treat as operating reality; reserve/insurance economics into model

Numbers can be directional. The point is: triggers must map to actions.

## Worked examples (Issue Frames)

### Example 1: Contract kill-switch (revenue durability)
**Context:** CIM says “sticky recurring revenue” and top accounts “multi-year.”

1) **What we saw (fact):**  
Top customer contracts include termination-for-convenience with 30–60 days notice; several also include change-of-control notification/consent language.

2) **Why it matters (economic mechanism):**  
Revenue is not contractually protected. Retention depends on operational execution and customer sentiment. This increases downside risk (sudden churn) and weakens any “contracted revenue” multiple argument.

3) **How big it could be (range):**  
Downside ranges from “no impact” (habitual renewals) to “step-down revenue event” if a top customer exits post-close. Model impact is primarily base case growth haircut + downside churn sensitivity.

4) **What must be true to neutralize it (verification plan):**  
- Cohort behavior for top 20 customers (gross profit view)  
- Renewal history and price realization on renewal periods  
- Evidence of switching costs (integration, compliance approvals, qualification processes)  
- Customer calls focused on “why you stay” and “what would make you leave”

5) **Action if adverse:**  
- Recut base case retention assumptions; increase downside churn  
- Reduce leverage and/or apply multiple compression  
- Push structure protection: earnout tied to retention, seller note, or escrow sizing that aligns with retention risk  
- Consider condition precedent if consents are required

6) **By when:**  
Within 72 hours. If not resolved, assume downside in model and escalate reprice path.

### Example 2: Revenue leakage (margin quality + QoE)
**Context:** Management presents stable gross margins and “pricing power.”

1) **What we saw (fact):**  
Credit memos and warranty concessions are larger and more frequent than expected; “special pricing approvals” appear concentrated in a few accounts.

2) **Why it matters (economic mechanism):**  
Reported gross margin may be overstated if concessions are treated as one-offs, inconsistently accrued, or netted in ways that hide true price realization. The real unit economics may be weaker and more volatile.

3) **How big it could be (range):**  
Could be a small normalization (tens of bps) or a structural margin haircut if leakage is the real mechanism of customer retention. Also creates working capital/true-up risk.

4) **What must be true to neutralize it (verification plan):**  
- Tie credit memos to customers, root causes, and timing  
- Reconcile warranty/claims accrual policy to actual claims paid  
- Customer-level gross profit bridge with concessions explicitly shown  
- Identify whether concessions are concentrated in top accounts (hidden price competition)

5) **Action if adverse:**  
- QoE adjustment: reclassify recurring concessions as ongoing costs  
- Normalize margin in base case; increase variance in downside  
- If leakage is “price to keep volume,” re-underwrite pricing power thesis and consider walking if returns fall below hurdle

6) **By when:**  
Before final model lock / financing discussions. If delayed, assume normalization haircut and adjust leverage.

### Example 3: Working capital trap (cash conversion)
**Context:** Deal underwrites strong EBITDA-to-FCF conversion and low capex.

1) **What we saw (fact):**  
AR aging shows worsening days outstanding; inventory obsolescence reserves appear light relative to aged inventory; billing cadence appears inconsistent.

2) **Why it matters (economic mechanism):**  
EBITDA may not convert to cash. Growth could require incremental working capital, reducing deleveraging and returns. In a downside, liquidity risk increases and lender flexibility tightens.

3) **How big it could be (range):**  
Base case FCF could be materially lower if AR collection is structurally slow or inventory turns are overstated. This can change leverage sizing and covenant headroom.

4) **What must be true to neutralize it (verification plan):**  
- Monthly WC bridge for 24–36 months (AR/AP/Inv) with seasonality  
- Customer payment terms vs actual payment behavior  
- Inventory aging by SKU and write-off history  
- Confirm whether collection issues are temporary (one customer dispute) or structural (process weakness)

5) **Action if adverse:**  
- Reduce EBITDA-to-FCF conversion; adjust debt sizing and returns  
- Structure: larger revolver, tighter liquidity covenants, or purchase price mechanisms aligned to WC  
- If WC volatility is high, push for tighter WC target/adjustment mechanics in SPA

6) **By when:**  
Before lender package and SPA working capital target negotiation. If not resolved, assume conservative WC and do not stretch leverage.

## What a deal-grade weekly update looks like (with examples)
### 1) Conviction delta (3 bullets max)
- Confidence in retention decreased: terminable-for-convenience terms in top contracts; need cohort + customer calls by Friday.
- Margin durability weaker: concessions/credit memos appear recurring; QoE adjustment path being quantified.
- Cash conversion risk increased: AR aging deterioration; WC bridge underway; assume conservative conversion until proven otherwise.

### 2) Top 5 open questions (ranked by decision impact)
Each must include owner + deadline + “if not resolved → we assume downside.”

### 3) Reprice / restructure candidates (explicit actions)
Not “risks,” but what you will do if confirmed.

### 4) Deal-killers (state them plainly)
Examples:
- inability to produce customer-level revenue/renewal detail
- required consents unlikely
- EBITDA materially inflated by recurring addbacks
- unquantifiable regulatory exposure
