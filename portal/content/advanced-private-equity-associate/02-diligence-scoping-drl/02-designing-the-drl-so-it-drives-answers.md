title: Designing the DRL So It Drives Answers (Not Data Dumps)
module: Diligence Scoping & DRL
lesson: 02
---

## The deal decision this lesson supports
**Whether diligence actually resolves underwriting risk in time to sign—or quietly pushes the deal toward a mushy IC, a late reprice, or a credibility loss with partners.**
This lesson is about turning the DRL from a “request list” into a **decision-forcing instrument**.

---

## The uncomfortable truth about most DRLs
Most DRLs fail for one simple reason:

> **They are written to be reasonable, not to extract truth.**

They prioritize politeness, completeness, and optics over forcing clarity. As a result:
- The company responds with *technically correct but economically evasive* data
- Advisors run analyses that don’t map cleanly to investment decisions
- Associates spend weeks reconciling datasets instead of answering “can we sign?”

A strong DRL is not neutral. It is **directional, skeptical, and intentional**.

## The real job of the DRL
A deal-grade DRL must do three things simultaneously:

1. **Force management to show their work**
2. **Create pressure where the narrative is weakest**
3. **Collapse ambiguity early enough to matter**

---

## Design principle #1: Ask for primitives, not outputs
Outputs are easy to shape. Primitives are hard to fake.

### Deal-grade request
Provide monthly revenue by customer (name + parent), by SKU/service line, for the last 36 months, reconciled to the GL.

**Rule:** If the analysis matters, you must own the dataset.

---

## Design principle #2: Every request must corner a claim
If a DRL item does not test a CIM claim, delete it.

---

## Design principle #3: Force comparability across time
Lock definitions or assume downside.

---

## Design principle #4: Anticipate the dodge
If they can’t provide it, that is information.

---

## Mini-template: DRL item spec
- Claim being tested
- Primitive data needed
- Decision impact if adverse

## Sharp synthesis
1. What breaks first?
2. What forces a reprice?
3. What are you explicitly assuming?
