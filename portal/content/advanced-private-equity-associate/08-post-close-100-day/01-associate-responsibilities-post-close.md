# Associate Responsibilities Post Close

## Outcomes
- Build a work product you could share internally.
- Identify the decisions and risks this work supports.
- Execute a repeatable workflow under time pressure.

## Agenda
- Define the objective and decision context.
- Gather the minimum inputs needed.
- Analyze and pressure-test assumptions.
- Translate findings into implications and next steps.

## Why this matters in a real deal
This work determines whether the deal narrative survives scrutiny. Done well, it improves decision quality and surfaces risk early. Done poorly, it creates false confidence and wastes diligence time.

## Deliverable
- Produce a 1–2 page output (memo, outline, or analysis) that is decision-relevant and defensible.

## Checklist
- [ ] Scope and definitions are explicit.
- [ ] Key assumptions are stated and testable.
- [ ] Downside risks are identified and prioritized.
- [ ] Findings translate into underwriting implications.
- [ ] Next diligence actions are clear.
## Learning Objectives

- Explain how associate responsibilities shift from deal execution to portfolio monitoring and value creation support
- Evaluate which post-close activities are associate-led versus VP-led or operating partner-led
- Develop frameworks for managing board reporting, KPI tracking, and management communications post-close
- Diagnose when associate involvement should decrease (transition complete) versus intensify (portfolio company struggling)
- Structure handoff processes from deal team to portfolio operations team if applicable
- Defend time allocation decisions when balancing post-close responsibilities with new deal sourcing

## Written Guide

### The Shift from Deal to Portfolio

Pre-close, associates focus on:
- Diligence
- IC preparation
- Transaction execution

Post-close, associates support:
- Board reporting and KPI tracking
- Value creation initiative monitoring
- Management relationship maintenance
- Problem-solving when issues arise

**Key shift**: From evaluating the business to improving it.

### Core Post-Close Responsibilities

**1. Board reporting and materials preparation**

Most PE-backed companies have quarterly board meetings. Associate responsibilities:
- Collect financial and KPI data from management
- Prepare board deck (financials, KPIs, value creation progress)
- Coordinate with operating partners or functional experts
- Attend board meetings (typically alongside VP or principal)

**2. KPI and financial monitoring**

- Track monthly or quarterly performance vs. plan
- Flag variances (revenue miss, margin compression, cash burn)
- Escalate issues to VP when performance deteriorates

**3. Value creation initiative tracking**

- Monitor progress on 100-day plan initiatives (pricing changes, cost reductions, hiring)
- Coordinate with management on milestones
- Report progress to investment team and LPs

**4. Management communication and support**

- Regular check-ins with CFO or CEO (biweekly or monthly)
- Ad hoc requests: Financial modeling, strategic analysis, recruiting support
- Relationship maintenance: Build trust and credibility

**5. Problem-solving and firefighting**

- When issues arise (customer loss, key employee departure, operational disruption), help management develop solutions
- Coordinate third-party resources (consultants, legal counsel)

**6. Exit preparation (Years 3–5)**

- Update CIM materials
- Coordinate sell-side diligence prep
- Support management presentations to buyers

### Time Allocation: Post-Close vs. New Deals

**Typical associate allocation**:
- **First 3–6 months post-close**: 30–50% on portfolio support, 50–70% on new deals
- **Months 6–24**: 10–20% on portfolio support, 80–90% on new deals
- **Exit prep (final 6–12 months of hold)**: 30–40% on exit support, 60–70% on new deals

**When portfolio support intensifies**:
- Company is underperforming (requires close monitoring and problem-solving)
- Major value creation initiative in progress (M&A integration, pricing overhaul, system implementation)
- Management turnover (new CFO or CEO onboarding)

**When portfolio support decreases**:
- Company is performing well and self-sufficient
- Operating partner has taken over day-to-day monitoring
- Transition to portfolio operations team complete

### Handoff to Portfolio Operations Team (if applicable)

Some firms have dedicated portfolio operations teams that own post-close monitoring after initial transition (typically 6–12 months post-close).

**Handoff process**:
1. **Transition meeting**: Deal team briefs portfolio ops on company history, value creation plan, key risks
2. **Document transfer**: Board decks, financial models, management contacts
3. **Relationship introduction**: Deal team introduces portfolio ops to management
4. **Ongoing coordination**: Portfolio ops takes over routine monitoring; deal team remains available for strategic issues or exit prep

**Associate role**: Facilitate smooth handoff, ensure all context is transferred, remain available for questions.

### Managing Management Expectations Post-Close

**Common post-close challenges**:

**Challenge 1: Management expects same responsiveness as during diligence**

During diligence, associates respond within hours. Post-close, response time may stretch to days (especially if working on new deals).

**Solution**: Set expectations upfront: "We will check in monthly. If urgent issues arise, call VP directly."

**Challenge 2: Management requests exceed associate bandwidth**

CFO asks associate to build monthly forecast model, update comp benchmarking, and help recruit VP of Sales—all in same week.

**Solution**: Prioritize requests. Escalate to VP if workload is unsustainable. Consider hiring finance consultant for tactical support.

**Challenge 3: Management resists PE oversight ("you don't understand our business")**

**Solution**: Build credibility through competence (see final lesson). Lean on operating partner for domain expertise.

### Balancing Portfolio and Deal Work

**Best practices**:

**1. Block time for portfolio work**

Dedicate specific days or half-days to portfolio companies. Avoid letting it become reactive.

**2. Delegate where possible**

Junior associates or analysts can prepare board decks, update KPI dashboards, coordinate data requests.

**3. Use templates and automation**

Standardize board deck templates, KPI dashboards, and reporting processes to reduce time investment.

**4. Escalate when appropriate**

If a portfolio company issue is strategic or urgent, escalate to VP or principal. Do not try to solve everything yourself.

**5. Communicate with your VP**

If portfolio work is overwhelming and affecting deal execution, raise it proactively.
