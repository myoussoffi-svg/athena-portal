title: Quality of Earnings — What Actually Matters (and What Doesn’t)
module: Third-Party Diligence
lesson: 01
---

## The deal decision this lesson supports
Whether reported EBITDA is real, repeatable, and financeable — or collapses once accounting optics are removed.

---

## QoE is an underwriting tool
It exists to test durability, volatility, and downside speed — not to validate management numbers.

---

## What IC actually cares about
Is EBITDA overstated, volatile, or dependent on behavior?

---

## Normalize economics, not accounting
Ask whether a rational owner would incur the cost again.

---

## The four addback categories that matter
Cost deferral, recurring one-offs, timing benefits, and behavior-dependent EBITDA.

---

## Common misses
Treating QoE as validation, accepting allowed addbacks, ignoring interaction effects, and siloing findings.

---

## How QoE must change the deal
Every finding should map to price, leverage, structure, or willingness to sign.

---

## Sharp synthesis
1) How much EBITDA is durable?
2) What disappears in a slowdown?
3) What reverses first?
4) How do returns change?
5) Are we financing real earnings?
