title: Quality of Earnings — What Actually Matters (and What Doesn’t)
module: Third-Party Diligence
lesson: 01
---

## The deal decision this lesson supports
Whether reported EBITDA is real, repeatable, and financeable — or collapses once accounting optics are removed.

---

## QoE is an underwriting tool
QoE’s job is not to validate the numbers but to help us understand whether those earnings can survive scrutiny. Does this EBITDA hold up under stress, or does it fall apart once we dig deeper?

---

## What IC actually cares about
- **Is EBITDA overstated?**  
- **Is it volatile?**  
- **Is it dependent on management decisions or behavior?**

If it’s any of those, you’ll need to adjust your assumptions. If it’s not, then you’re on solid ground.

---

## Normalize economics, not accounting
The point of QoE is to look at the **economic reality**, not just how the books are presented. Ask yourself: would a rational owner incur these costs again in the same way?

---

## The four addback categories that matter
- **Cost deferral**: Are we pushing costs into future periods?  
- **Recurring one-offs**: Are we calling non-recurring items "one-time" when they really aren’t?  
- **Timing benefits**: Did we get a short-term bump that won’t last?  
- **Behavior-dependent EBITDA**: Is this something that happens because management is in control, and would this change under new ownership?

---

## Common misses
- Treating QoE as validation instead of an adjustment tool.  
- Accepting allowed addbacks without questioning their real impact.  
- Ignoring how different findings interact with one another.  
- Treating QoE as a one-off task, not something that needs to be revisited regularly as new findings emerge.

## How QoE must change the deal
Every finding should force you to make a decision — either to reprice, restructure, or re-evaluate the deal based on what you've learned.

## Sharp synthesis
1. **How much EBITDA is durable?**  
2. **What disappears in a slowdown?**  
3. **What reverses first?**  
4. **How do returns change?**  
5. **Are we financing real earnings?**
