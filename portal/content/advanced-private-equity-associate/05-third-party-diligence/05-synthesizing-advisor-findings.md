title: Synthesizing Advisor Findings — Turning Third-Party Work Into IC Conviction
module: Third-Party Diligence
lesson: 05
---

## The deal decision this lesson supports
Whether third-party diligence clarifies conviction and drives a decision — or obscures it.

---

## Advisors analyze; investors decide
Third-party work informs judgment but does not replace it.

---

## The synthesis hierarchy
What changed, what matters economically, and what we do about it.

---

## No orphan findings
Every material issue must map to price, structure, assumptions, or willingness to proceed.

---

## Final IC narrative
Why it works, what must be true, what changed, where downside concentrates, and what we recommend.

---

## Common failure modes
Letting advisors speak, false balance, hiding behind detail, and avoiding recommendations.

---

## Sharp synthesis
1) What did diligence disprove?
2) Weakest assumption?
3) Where is downside concentrated?
4) What changed?
5) Why proceed or walk now?
