title: Synthesizing Advisor Findings — Turning Third-Party Work Into IC Conviction
module: Third-Party Diligence
lesson: 05
---

## The deal decision this lesson supports
Whether third-party diligence clarifies conviction and drives a decision — or obscures it.

---

## Advisors analyze; investors decide
Third-party findings inform decisions, but **the decision** is yours. You are responsible for:
- **clarifying conviction**
- **pricing and structuring the deal**
- **deciding whether to move forward or walk**

---

## The synthesis hierarchy
Every third-party finding should fit into one of three categories:
1. **What changed?**
2. **What matters economically?**
3. **What do we do about it?**

---

## No orphan findings
Every issue should **map to a decision** — price, structure, assumptions, or willingness to proceed.

---

## Final IC narrative
The synthesis should clearly answer:
1. **Why the deal works**  
2. **What must be true for it to succeed**  
3. **What changed in diligence**  
4. **Where downside is concentrated**  
5. **What we recommend** (and why)

---

## Common failure modes
- Letting advisors speak for the deal.  
- Hiding behind detail instead of judgment.  
- Failing to update assumptions after reviewing findings.  
- Avoiding negative conclusions or hard truths.

## Sharp synthesis
1. **What did diligence disprove?**  
2. **What’s the weakest assumption?**  
3. **Where is downside concentrated?**  
4. **What’s changed?**  
5. **Why are we proceeding — or why walking is the better choice?**
