title: Tax & Legal Diligence — What Associates Actually Need to Care About
module: Third-Party Diligence
lesson: 03
---

## The deal decision this lesson supports
Whether tax or legal exposure can block closing, impair cash flow, or create unbounded downside.

---

## Classify risk, don’t catalogue it
Every issue must be binary, bounded, economic, or cosmetic.

---

## Tax risks that matter
Payroll, sales/use, and cash tax normalization drive real exposure.

---

## Legal risks that break deals
Consents, litigation patterns, and regulatory exposure matter more than memo length.

---

## How to read memos efficiently
Skip background; classify issues by decision impact.

---

## Common failure modes
Treating all issues equally, hiding behind advisors, ignoring cash timing, and letting diligence drift.

---

## Sharp synthesis
1) What blocks closing?
2) What is unbounded?
3) What hits cash?
4) What is priceable?
5) What can we ignore?
