title: Tax & Legal Diligence — What Associates Actually Need to Care About
module: Third-Party Diligence
lesson: 03
---

## The deal decision this lesson supports
Whether tax or legal exposure can block closing, impair cash flow, or create unbounded downside.

---

## Classify risk, don’t catalogue it
Tax and legal diligence should be focused on **classifying risks**. Don’t just list issues — figure out **whether they block the deal, add unbounded liability, impair cash flow, or can be priced/managed.**

---

## Tax risks that matter
- **Payroll and employment tax**: Missed taxes from misclassified employees or inconsistent filings can quickly become material.  
- **Sales and use tax**: Often unaccrued or discovered post-close.  
- **Income tax normalization**: Watch for deductions or tax assets that won’t survive a change of ownership.

---

## Legal risks that break deals
Look for:
- **Consents**: Do key contracts require approvals?  
- **Litigation patterns**: Is there a history of repeat claims or lawsuits?  
- **Regulatory exposure**: What licenses are required, and are they transferable?

---

## How to read memos efficiently
Skip the background. Focus on the **summary of findings**. For each issue, ask:
- Does this risk block the deal?  
- Is it bounded or unbounded?  
- Does it affect cash flow?

---

## Common failure modes
- **Treating all issues equally**: Not every risk is worth the same amount of attention.  
- **Hiding behind advisors**: Don’t defer to advisors for judgment calls — they’re there to identify risks, but the decisions are yours.  
- **Ignoring timing**: Even small issues can grow significantly if they hit cash flow immediately post-close.  
- **Letting legal and tax diligence drag**: Don’t wait for a perfect answer — if the answer is clear, act on it.

## Sharp synthesis
1. **What risks can block closing?**  
2. **What exposure is unbounded?**  
3. **What hits cash flow immediately post-close?**  
4. **What can we price or restructure?**  
5. **What can we safely ignore?**
