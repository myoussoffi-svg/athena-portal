title: Market Diligence Sanity Checks — When to Trust It, When to Override It
module: Third-Party Diligence
lesson: 02
---

## The deal decision this lesson supports
Whether third-party market diligence meaningfully increases conviction — or falsely reassures the team.

---

## Market diligence is a control function
It should pressure-test your thesis, not replace judgment.

---

## The three questions that matter
Is growth real or cyclical? Is differentiation structural? How do customers behave under stress?

---

## Sanity checks
Test cycle exposure, switching behavior, pricing tolerance, and incentive alignment.

---

## Where market diligence adds value
Contradiction, segmentation, substitution, and downside bounding.

---

## Common failure modes
Outsourcing judgment, repeating consultant language, ignoring variance, and delaying decisions.

---

## How it must change the deal
Growth, margins, downside severity, or willingness to proceed must move.

---

## Sharp synthesis
1) Weakest assumption?
2) Customer behavior risk?
3) What breaks first?
4) Downside impact?
5) Does it still clear hurdles?
