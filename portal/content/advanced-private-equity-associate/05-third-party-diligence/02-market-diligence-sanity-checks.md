## Checklist
- [ ] Scope and definitions are explicit.
- [ ] Key assumptions are stated and testable.
- [ ] Downside risks are identified and prioritized.
- [ ] Findings translate into underwriting implications.
- [ ] Next diligence actions are clear.
## Learning Objectives

- Explain the purpose and typical scope of third-party market or commercial diligence studies
- Evaluate whether market study findings align with or contradict management's narrative about market size, growth, and positioning

### What is Market Diligence and Why It is Commissioned

Market diligence (also called commercial diligence) is an independent assessment of market size, growth drivers, competitive dynamics, and the target company's positioning.

**Conducted by**: Strategy consulting firms (Bain, BCG, McKinsey) or specialized boutiques (e.g., GLG, AlphaSights, L.E.K., ClearView)

**Purpose**:
1. Validate management's claims about market size and growth
2. Assess competitive positioning and differentiation
3. Identify market headwinds or tailwinds
4. Inform growth assumptions in the financial model and value creation plan

**Typical scope**:
- Total addressable market (TAM) sizing
- Market growth rates and drivers
- Competitive landscape and market share analysis
- Customer interviews or surveys
- Industry trends and risks

**Cost**: $50K–$200K depending on scope and consultant

**Timeline**: 4–6 weeks from kickoff to final report

### When to Commission Market Diligence

Not all deals require third-party market diligence. Commission it when:

1. **Market dynamics are critical to the thesis**: If the thesis is "ride the wave of market growth," you must validate that the market is actually growing.

2. **Management's market claims are unsubstantiated**: CIM says "$10B TAM growing at 15%," but no credible source is cited.

3. **Competitive positioning is unclear**: Multiple players claim to be "market leaders"; you need independent validation.

4. **You lack internal expertise**: The business operates in a niche industry where your team has limited knowledge.

**When market diligence is not needed**:
- Market is well-understood and thesis does not depend on market growth
- Strong internal expertise exists (e.g., your firm has multiple portfolio companies in this sector)
- Budget constraints and the deal is small

### Common Market Study Deliverables

**1. Market sizing and segmentation**

- TAM (Total Addressable Market): The total revenue opportunity if the company served 100% of all potential customers
- SAM (Serviceable Available Market): The portion of TAM the company can realistically target given its product and go-to-market
- SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market): The portion of SAM the company can realistically capture in the near term

**2. Market growth forecast**

- Historical growth rates (past 3–5 years)
- Projected growth rates (next 3–5 years)
- Growth drivers (regulatory changes, technology adoption, end-market demand)

**3. Competitive landscape**

- Market share by player
- Competitor strengths and weaknesses
- Competitive positioning map

**4. Customer insights**

- Voice-of-customer interviews (10–20 customers)
- NPS or satisfaction benchmarking
- Reasons for choosing the target vs. competitors

**5. Risk and trend assessment**

- Market headwinds (commoditization, regulation, substitutes)
- Emerging trends (technology shifts, new entrants)

### Sanity-Checking TAM/SAM/SOM Calculations

Market sizing is notoriously squishy. Consultants often use top-down or bottom-up approaches that can yield wildly different results.

**Top-down approach**:
Start with a large market (e.g., "total software spend in healthcare = $50B") and narrow down based on segments the company serves.

**Bottom-up approach**:
Start with customer unit economics (e.g., "10,000 potential customers × $100K average deal size = $1B TAM").

**Sanity check questions**:

1. **Is the TAM realistic or aspirational?**
   - If the company has $50M revenue and the study claims TAM is $100B, is that because the company serves a tiny niche, or because the TAM definition is too broad?

2. **Is the SAM definition credible?**
   - Does it account for geographic, regulatory, or product limitations?

3. **Is the SOM achievable?**
   - If the company has 1% market share today and the study assumes 5% in 5 years, what would drive that? Is it funded in the value creation plan?

4. **Do top-down and bottom-up approaches align?**
   - If top-down says $10B TAM but bottom-up says $2B, there is a definitional mismatch. Probe why.

**Red flag example**:

Market study says: "TAM is $20B."
Your check: Company revenue is $30M. That implies 0.15% market share. If true, there is massive headroom. But if the TAM definition is too broad (e.g., includes adjacent markets the company does not serve), the real TAM may be $500M and market share is 6%—very different implication for growth potential.

### Assessing Competitive Positioning Claims

Market studies often include competitive positioning maps (e.g., "target company is a leader in quality but mid-tier on price").

**How to validate**:

1. **Compare to customer interviews**: Do customers agree with this positioning?

2. **Compare to management's view**: Does management describe themselves the same way the market study does? If not, why?

3. **Look for evidence**: If the study claims "best-in-class product," what metrics support that? (e.g., NPS, win rates, feature comparisons)

**Red flag**: Study concludes "target is a market leader," but market share is 3% and declining. Leadership is not supported by data.

### Customer Interview Insights: What to Extract

Market studies often include 10–20 customer interviews. These are gold for validation.

**Key questions the consultant should ask customers**:

- Why did you choose this vendor?
- How does this vendor compare to competitors?
- What would cause you to switch?
- How likely are you to renew/expand?
- What could this vendor improve?

**What to extract from the interview summary**:

1. **Retention risk signals**: If multiple customers mention "we are evaluating alternatives," that is a red flag.

2. **Differentiation validation**: Do customers cite the same differentiators management claims, or different ones?

3. **Pricing power validation**: Are customers price-sensitive, or do they say "we would pay more for this product"?

**Red flag**: Customers interviewed are all top accounts hand-picked by management. Push the consultant to interview a random sample, including recently churned customers if possible.

### Growth Projections: Credible vs. Optimistic

Market studies will project market growth (e.g., "market will grow at 12% CAGR through 2028").

**Assess credibility**:

1. **What is the basis for the projection?**
   - Industry reports (e.g., Gartner, Forrester)
   - Regression analysis of historical trends
   - Expert interviews
   - Consultant's judgment

2. **Does it pass the smell test?**
   - If GDP is growing at 2% and the market is projected to grow at 25%, what is the catalyst?

3. **Is growth evenly distributed or concentrated?**
   - If growth is driven by one new technology or regulation, is that adoption certain or speculative?

4. **How does projected market growth compare to target company growth?**
   - If market is growing at 5% but the company grew at 15%, they are taking share. Is that sustainable?
   - If market is growing at 15% but the company grew at 3%, they are losing share. Why?

**Red flag**: Projected market growth conveniently matches management's revenue growth assumptions. This suggests the study is backward-engineered to support the thesis.

### Identifying Gaps or Weaknesses in Market Studies

No market study is perfect. Common weaknesses:

**Weakness 1: Over-reliance on secondary sources**

Study cites 10 different industry reports but does not reconcile conflicting data. You are left with a range ("market is $5B to $15B").

**Your action**: Ask the consultant which estimate they find most credible and why.

**Weakness 2: Limited primary research**

Only 5 customer interviews conducted due to NDAs or access limitations.

**Your action**: Supplement with your own customer reference calls if possible, or treat customer insights section as directional only.

**Weakness 3: Generic industry trends, not company-specific**

Study spends 20 pages on "healthcare IT trends" but only 5 pages on how the target company is positioned to capitalize.

**Your action**: Push the consultant to connect trends to the specific company's strategy and differentiation.

**Weakness 4: Bullish bias**

Consultants are often incentivized (implicitly or explicitly) to produce findings that support the deal. They know the PE firm wants to invest.

**Your action**: Ask the consultant directly, "What are the risks or reasons this company might underperform the market?"

### Integrating Market Study Findings into IC Materials

**Where market diligence informs the IC memo**:

1. **Market overview section**: Use TAM/SAM/SOM figures, growth rates, and trends

2. **Competitive positioning section**: Reference market share and competitive dynamics

3. **Growth assumptions**: If the model assumes 15% revenue growth and the market is growing at 8%, explain how the company will outgrow the market (share gain, new products, geographic expansion)

4. **Risks section**: Include market headwinds flagged in the study (e.g., commoditization, regulatory risk)

**How to present**:

"Per [Consultant Firm] market study, the TAM is estimated at $8B growing at 10% annually. The target has ~2% market share. Market growth is driven by [specific trends]. Key risks include [specific risks]. Customer interviews confirm strong NPS (65) and differentiation around [specific attributes]."

### Challenging Market Study Conclusions

If the market study conclusions do not align with your diligence or management's view, probe.

**Scenario 1: Market study is more bearish than management**

Study says: "Market is growing at 5%."
Management says: "Market is growing at 12%."

**Your action**: Understand the definitional difference. Are they measuring the same market segment? Are they using different timeframes or sources?

**Scenario 2: Market study contradicts VDR data**

Study says: "Company is gaining market share."
VDR shows: Revenue growth is slower than market growth (implying share loss).

**Your action**: Escalate the discrepancy to your VP. This is a red flag about either the study's accuracy or the company's performance.

**When to challenge**:
- Study relies on outdated data
- Study methodology is unclear or weak
- Study findings are internally inconsistent

**When to accept**:
- Study is based on rigorous primary research
- Consultant has deep sector expertise
- Findings align with other diligence workstreams
