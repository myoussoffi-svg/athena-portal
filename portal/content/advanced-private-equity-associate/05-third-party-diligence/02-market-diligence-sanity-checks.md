title: Market Diligence Sanity Checks — When to Trust It, When to Override It
module: Third-Party Diligence
lesson: 02

## The deal decision this lesson supports
Whether third-party market diligence meaningfully increases conviction — or falsely reassures the team.

## Market diligence is a control function
Market diligence isn't here to tell us how great the market is — it’s here to challenge our assumptions and test whether the business can actually meet its growth expectations. If the diligence only confirms what we already think, it’s useless.

---

## The three questions that matter
- **Is growth real or cyclical?**  
- **Is differentiation structural, or is it fragile?**  
- **How do customers behave under stress?**

If market diligence doesn’t answer these questions, it’s not helping.

---

## Sanity checks
Test for:
- **Cycle exposure**: Is this growth tied to the market cycle, or is it more durable?  
- **Switching behavior**: How hard is it for customers to leave or switch providers?  
- **Pricing tolerance**: What’s the customer’s willingness to accept price increases?  
- **Incentive alignment**: Are the incentives for the company and its customers aligned to drive long-term growth?

---

## Where market diligence adds value
Look for:
- **Contradiction**: Does the market tell a different story than the company’s narrative?  
- **Segmentation**: Are some market segments more valuable than others?  
- **Substitution**: Are there alternatives or substitutes in the market?  
- **Downside bounding**: Does the market have limits, or can it grow indefinitely?

---

## Common failure modes
- **Outsourcing judgment**: Don’t rely solely on consultants — use market findings as a tool to test your own assumptions.  
- **Repeating consultant language**: Avoid parroting what the consultants say. Analyze their conclusions critically.  
- **Ignoring variance**: Don’t assume a single story fits all. Every market is different, and different customers have different behaviors.  
- **Delaying decisions**: Waiting for the perfect data set or the perfect conclusion only delays the deal.

## How it must change the deal
If the market diligence doesn’t give us new insight, or if it undermines our assumptions, it needs to change something — either the growth projections, the pricing assumptions, or the risks we’ve identified.

## Sharp synthesis
1. **What is the weakest assumption we have about market growth?**  
2. **What’s the most significant risk tied to customer behavior?**  
3. **What would break first if things go wrong?**  
4. **What’s the downside impact?**  
5. **Does the market still meet our investment hurdles?**
