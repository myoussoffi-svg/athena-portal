title: Cross-Workstream Risk — When Issues Compound (and Kill Deals Quietly)
module: Third-Party Diligence
lesson: 04
---

## The deal decision this lesson supports
Whether multiple manageable risks interact in ways that materially impair returns, leverage, or execution.

---

## Risk compounds horizontally
Issues don’t fail in isolation. They interact, and those interactions often amplify the downside. Look for **compounding risks** that aren’t apparent when reviewing workstreams in isolation.

---

## The compounding-risk lens
Ask:
- Does one risk accelerate another?  
- Do multiple risks hit at the same time (e.g., Year 1–2)?  
- Do mitigating actions depend on the same management or resources?

---

## Common compounding patterns
- **Pricing + churn**: Price sensitivity and high churn can collapse growth projections faster than expected.  
- **Labor + growth**: Growth that requires additional labor may not be sustainable if labor costs are already high.  
- **Data integrity + leverage**: Relying on earnings you can’t verify makes the financing fragile.  
- **Founder dependency + integration**: Founder departure undermines integration and creates execution risk.

---

## How to surface interaction
For each pair of risks, ask:
- What happens if both occur?  
- Can we mitigate them separately, or do they amplify each other?  
- Does one accelerate the other?

---

## How it must change the deal
When risks compound, the deal terms must change. This often means:
- **repricing**  
- **reducing leverage**  
- **restructuring the deal**

---

## Sharp synthesis
1. **Which two risks reinforce each other?**  
2. **What breaks first when they interact?**  
3. **Does downside accelerate or compound linearly?**  
4. **Can mitigation realistically happen in time?**  
5. **What deal term changes because of this?**
