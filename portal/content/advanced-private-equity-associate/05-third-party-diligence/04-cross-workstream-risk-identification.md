title: Cross-Workstream Risk — When Issues Compound (and Kill Deals Quietly)
module: Third-Party Diligence
lesson: 04
---

## The deal decision this lesson supports
Whether multiple manageable risks interact in ways that materially impair returns, leverage, or execution.

---

## Risk compounds horizontally
Issues rarely fail alone; interaction is what kills deals.

---

## The compounding-risk lens
Evaluate economic, timing, and control overlap.

---

## Common compounding patterns
Pricing + churn, labor + growth, data integrity + leverage, founder dependency + integration.

---

## How to surface interaction
Write the risk stack, force interaction questions, and stress logic before models.

---

## How it must change the deal
Compounding risk requires repricing, de-levering, restructuring, or walking.

---

## Sharp synthesis
1) Which risks reinforce?
2) What breaks first?
3) Does downside accelerate?
4) Can mitigation happen in time?
5) What deal term changes?
