# Handling Model Questions and Assumption Challenges

## Learning Objectives

- Explain your LBO model logic clearly and concisely when presenting to interviewers
- Defend assumptions under challenge without being defensive
- Handle curveball questions or requests to modify assumptions on the fly
- Demonstrate judgment and flexibility when interviewers push back

## Written Guide

### Why Interviewers Challenge Your Model

After you submit an LBO model, interviewers will ask questions to assess:

**Technical understanding**: Do you know what you built, or did you copy a template?

**Judgment**: Are your assumptions reasonable, and can you defend them?

**Flexibility**: Can you handle unexpected questions or adjust assumptions?

**Communication**: Can you explain complex concepts clearly?

**Composure**: Do you stay calm under pressure, or do you get flustered?

Expect to be challenged. This is not personal—it's part of the interview.

### Common Questions About Your Model

**"Walk me through your model."**

This is an open-ended invitation to explain your work. Structure your response:

1. **Setup**: "I valued this LBO assuming a $1 billion purchase price at 10× EBITDA, with 70% debt and 30% equity."
2. **Projections**: "I projected revenue growth at 6% annually and modest margin expansion, driving exit EBITDA to $150M."
3. **Debt paydown**: "The company generates about $40M per year in free cash flow, which I used to pay down debt. By Year 5, debt declines from $700M to $500M."
4. **Exit and returns**: "At exit, I assumed a 9.5× multiple on $150M EBITDA, giving an exit EV of $1.425B. Subtracting $500M remaining debt, ending equity value is $925M, for a 3.1× MOIC and 25% IRR."

Be concise. Don't narrate every cell.

**"Why did you assume [X assumption]?"**

Be ready to defend every assumption:

- **Revenue growth**: "I assumed 6% growth based on historical trends and industry projections. The company has been growing 5-7% historically, and the market is expected to grow 4-5%."
- **Margin expansion**: "I assumed 100 bps of margin expansion from operating leverage and cost optimization. This is conservative compared to similar LBOs in the sector."
- **Exit multiple**: "I assumed 9.5×, which is slightly below the 10× entry multiple, to be conservative."

Always reference **case materials, industry benchmarks, or historical data** when possible.

**"What if revenue growth is only 3% instead of 6%?"**

This tests whether you understand sensitivity. Respond:

"If revenue growth is 3% instead of 6%, exit EBITDA would be lower—around $125M instead of $150M. At the same 9.5× exit multiple, exit EV would be $1.19B. After subtracting $500M debt, ending equity is $690M, giving a 2.3× MOIC and about 18% IRR. So the deal still works, but returns are materially lower."

If you built sensitivities, reference them: "I've sensitized this—at 3% growth, IRR drops from 25% to 18%."

**"What's the biggest risk in this model?"**

Interviewers want to see that you've thought critically about downside. Good answers:

- **EBITDA underperformance**: "If revenue or margins miss projections, exit EBITDA will be lower, which reduces returns."
- **Multiple compression**: "If the exit multiple compresses to 8.5× due to market conditions, IRR drops by 3-4 percentage points."
- **Inability to service debt**: "If cash flow declines, the company may struggle to service interest or pay down debt, increasing default risk."

Show that you've considered downside scenarios.

**"Could you raise more debt?"**

This tests understanding of leverage constraints. Respond:

"I used 5.0× Debt/EBITDA, which is in line with recent sponsor-backed deals. At this level, interest coverage is 2.5×, which provides comfortable headroom. I could potentially raise another 0.5× of debt, bringing leverage to 5.5×, but that would reduce interest coverage to 2.2× and increase default risk if EBITDA underperforms. I'd prefer to maintain flexibility."

If they push: "If you forced me to use 6.0× leverage, I could model it, but I'd want to stress-test downside scenarios to ensure the company can still service interest."

**"Walk me through what happens to the three statements if EBITDA increases by $10."**

This is a classic follow-up to test accounting knowledge. See the IB course for detailed mechanics, but briefly:

- Income statement: EBITDA +$10 → EBIT +$10 → taxes (assume 25%) → net income +$7.50
- Cash flow: Net income +$7.50 → cash flow from operations +$7.50 → debt paydown +$7.50
- Balance sheet: Debt -$7.50, cash +$7.50 (or equity +$7.50 via retained earnings)

**"What would you do to improve this business?"**

This shifts from modeling to investment judgment. Respond with operational improvements:

- "I'd focus on margin expansion through cost optimization—renegotiating supplier contracts, streamlining SG&A, improving procurement."
- "I'd invest in sales and marketing to accelerate revenue growth in underpenetrated markets."
- "I'd consider add-on acquisitions to consolidate the market and achieve economies of scale."

Don't just say "grow revenue and improve margins." Be specific.

### How to Handle Being Wrong

If you make a mistake or get a question wrong:

1. **Acknowledge it**: "You're right—I should have checked interest coverage before sizing debt."
2. **Explain your thinking**: "I was focused on matching market leverage multiples, but I should have validated that the company can service that debt."
3. **Offer to correct it**: "If I re-ran the model, I'd reduce leverage to 5.0× to ensure 2.5× interest coverage."

Interviewers respect candidates who admit mistakes and adjust.

### Curveball Questions and Adjustments

Interviewers may ask you to change an assumption on the fly:

**"What if we only put in 25% equity instead of 30%?"**

- More debt → higher leverage → higher interest expense → less cash for debt paydown → higher remaining debt at exit → lower equity value
- Returns could be higher (less equity invested) or lower (higher remaining debt)—depends on the balance

Think through the mechanics out loud: "More debt means higher interest expense, which reduces cash available for debt paydown. Remaining debt at exit would be higher. Let me think... Initial equity drops from $300M to $250M, but if remaining debt increases from $500M to $550M, exit equity value drops by $50M as well. Net effect: MOIC probably stays similar or declines slightly."

You don't need to calculate precisely—show logical reasoning.

### Common Mistakes

**Being defensive**: Don't argue with the interviewer. If they challenge an assumption, acknowledge the risk and explain your rationale.

**Not knowing your own model**: If you can't explain why you made a choice, it looks bad. Know your model inside and out.

**Overconfident answers**: Saying "I'm 100% confident in this assumption" invites pushback. Say "I think this is reasonable based on [X], but I've sensitized it to show variability."

**Rambling**: Be concise. A 30-second answer is better than a 3-minute explanation.
