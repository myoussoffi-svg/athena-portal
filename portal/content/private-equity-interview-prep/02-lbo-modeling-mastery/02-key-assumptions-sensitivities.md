# Key Assumptions and Sensitivities in LBO Models

## Learning Objectives

- Identify the key assumptions that drive LBO returns and understand their relative impact
- Explain how to set reasonable assumptions when limited information is provided
- Build and interpret sensitivity tables to assess return variability
- Defend assumption choices when challenged by interviewers

## Written Guide

### Why Assumptions Matter

LBO returns are highly sensitive to a small number of key assumptions. Understanding which levers matter most—and being able to defend your choices—is critical in interviews. Interviewers will often ask:

- "Why did you assume 8% revenue growth?"
- "What if EBITDA margins decline instead of expanding?"
- "How confident are you in this exit multiple?"

You must be able to explain your logic and show that you've considered alternatives.

### The Five Key Assumption Categories

**1. Purchase Price and Entry Valuation**:
- Entry multiple (EV/EBITDA)
- Enterprise value
- Equity purchase price

The lower the entry multiple, the higher the returns (all else equal). PE firms seek to buy at reasonable multiples relative to growth and quality.

**2. Operating Performance**:
- Revenue growth rate
- EBITDA margin expansion (or contraction)
- CapEx as % of revenue
- Working capital as % of revenue

Revenue growth and margin improvement directly increase exit EBITDA, which drives returns. However, aggressive assumptions are risky. Interviewers test whether you're being realistic.

**3. Capital Structure**:
- Debt as % of purchase price (or Debt/EBITDA multiple)
- Debt structure (term loans, bonds, revolver)
- Interest rates
- Amortization schedule

Higher leverage amplifies returns but increases risk. Too much debt can lead to covenant violations or inability to service interest.

**4. Exit Assumptions**:
- Exit year (typically 5 years)
- Exit multiple (EV/EBITDA at exit)
- Exit EBITDA (driven by operating assumptions)

The exit multiple is one of the most sensitive assumptions. A 1-turn difference (e.g., 10× vs. 9×) can swing IRR by 3-5 percentage points.

**5. Tax Rate**:
- Corporate tax rate (federal + state)
- Tax shields from interest deductibility

Taxes reduce cash flow available for debt paydown and reduce net income at exit. A 25% tax rate is standard for U.S. models, but this varies by jurisdiction.

### How to Set Reasonable Assumptions

**Use the case materials**:
- If the CIM provides historical growth rates or margin trends, use those as a starting point
- If management projections are provided, consider them but apply scrutiny (management is often optimistic)

**Apply industry benchmarks**:
- If revenue growth isn't specified, use industry averages (e.g., 3-5% for mature industries, 8-12% for high-growth sectors)
- Margin expansion should be justified by specific initiatives (cost cuts, pricing power, operating leverage)

**Be conservative**:
- In an interview, it's better to be conservative and defend realistic assumptions than to be aggressive and get challenged
- Assume flat or modest improvement unless there's a clear reason for optimism

**Check reasonableness**:
- Does 15% revenue growth make sense for a mature industrial company? Probably not.
- Does 40% EBITDA margin make sense for a low-margin retail business? No.

**State your assumptions explicitly**:
- In your assumptions section, write clear labels: "Revenue growth: 6% per year" and "EBITDA margin: expands from 20% to 22% over 5 years"

### Building Sensitivity Tables

Sensitivity tables show how returns change when key assumptions vary. They help you understand risk and give interviewers insight into your thinking.

**Common sensitivity tables**:

**1. Exit Multiple vs. Revenue Growth**:
- Rows: Exit multiple (8.0×, 9.0×, 10.0×, 11.0×, 12.0×)
- Columns: Revenue CAGR (4%, 6%, 8%, 10%)
- Cells: IRR or MOIC

**2. Exit Multiple vs. EBITDA Margin**:
- Rows: Exit multiple
- Columns: Exit EBITDA margin (18%, 20%, 22%, 24%)
- Cells: IRR or MOIC

**3. Exit Multiple vs. Entry Multiple**:
- Rows: Exit multiple
- Columns: Entry multiple
- Cells: IRR

Use Excel's **Data Table** feature to automate sensitivity tables. This saves time and ensures accuracy.

### Interpreting Sensitivities

When reviewing sensitivities, consider:

**Range of outcomes**: If IRR ranges from 15% to 35% across reasonable scenarios, the investment has high variability. If it ranges from 22% to 28%, returns are more stable.

**Downside protection**: What happens in the worst-case scenario (low growth, low exit multiple)? If IRR drops below 15%, the deal may not be attractive.

**Key drivers**: Which assumption has the biggest impact? Usually, it's the exit multiple or EBITDA growth. Focus your diligence and defense on these drivers.

### Defending Your Assumptions

Interviewers will challenge your assumptions. Be ready to defend them:

**Q: "Why did you assume 8% revenue growth?"**

**A**: "The company has grown 7-9% historically, and the industry is projected to grow 5-6% annually. I assumed the company continues to gain market share, which justifies slightly above-market growth. However, I've sensitized this assumption, and even at 5% growth, the deal still returns 20%+ IRR."

**Q: "What if margins compress instead of expanding?"**

**A**: "That's a key risk. I assumed modest margin expansion from 20% to 22% due to operating leverage as revenue scales. If margins stay flat or compress, exit EBITDA would be lower, which would hurt returns. In my downside sensitivity, I've modeled flat margins, and the deal still clears a 15% IRR hurdle."

**Q: "Why do you think you can exit at 10× EBITDA?"**

**A**: "I assumed a 10× exit multiple, which is in line with recent comps in this sector. If multiples compress, returns decline—at a 9× exit, IRR drops to 18%. However, the company's quality and growth profile should support a market-level multiple."

### Common Mistakes

**Using aggressive assumptions without justification**: Assuming 15% revenue growth and 500 bps of margin expansion without explaining why will get challenged.

**Not sensitizing key assumptions**: If you only show a base case, interviewers have no sense of risk or variability.

**Being defensive when challenged**: If an interviewer questions your assumptions, don't argue. Acknowledge the risk, explain your rationale, and point to sensitivities.

**Assuming unrealistic exit multiples**: Exit multiples should generally be close to entry multiples (or slightly lower). Assuming multiple expansion from 8× to 12× is aggressive without a strong story.

## Key Takeaways

- LBO returns are highly sensitive to entry multiple, revenue growth, EBITDA margin, capital structure, and exit multiple
- Set reasonable assumptions using case materials, industry benchmarks, and conservative estimates
- Build sensitivity tables (exit multiple vs. growth, exit multiple vs. margin) to show return variability
- Interviewers will challenge assumptions; be ready to defend your rationale and acknowledge risks
- Avoid aggressive assumptions without justification; point to sensitivities to demonstrate downside awareness
- Exit multiples should generally be close to or slightly below entry multiples unless there's a strong improvement story
