- Explain how industry analysis informs investment decisions

## Written Guide

### Why Industry Analysis Matters

Understanding the industry is critical to evaluating whether a company can succeed. A great company in a terrible industry may struggle. A mediocre company in a booming industry may thrive.

PE investors assess:
- Is this an attractive industry to invest in?
- What are the growth drivers and risks?
- How is our target positioned relative to competitors?

### Porter's Five Forces Framework

Use Porter's Five Forces to assess industry attractiveness:

**1. Competitive Rivalry**: How intense is competition? Fragmented vs. consolidated, price wars vs. rational pricing. High rivalry means lower margins.

**2. Threat of New Entrants**: Are there barriers to entry (capital, regulation, brand, network effects)? High barriers protect incumbent profits.

**3. Bargaining Power of Suppliers**: Can suppliers raise prices or limit supply? High supplier power creates margin pressure.

**4. Bargaining Power of Buyers**: Can customers negotiate aggressively? High buyer power limits pricing.

**5. Threat of Substitutes**: Are there alternative products? High threat limits pricing power.

Attractive industries have low rivalry, high barriers, weak supplier/buyer power, and few substitutes.

### Key Industry Metrics

**Market size and growth**: TAM, growth rate. Fast-growing markets offer upside; declining markets are risky.

**Fragmentation**: Fragmented industries offer consolidation opportunities.

**Regulation**: Can create barriers (good) or risks (compliance costs).

**Technology disruption**: Is the industry being disrupted?

**Cyclicality**: Is demand tied to economic cycles? Cyclical industries are riskier for LBOs.

### Tailwinds and Headwinds

Identify secular trends:

**Tailwinds**: Demographics, technology adoption, favorable regulation

**Headwinds**: Disruption, regulatory pressure, macro trends

### How Industry Analysis Informs Decisions

Attractive, growing industry → justifies higher multiples, supports growth assumptions

Unattractive, declining industry → requires lower multiples, conservative assumptions
