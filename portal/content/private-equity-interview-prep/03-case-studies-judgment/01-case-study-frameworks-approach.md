# Case Study Frameworks and Approach

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the structure and format of PE case studies (take-home and live)
- Apply a structured framework to analyze investment opportunities efficiently
- Prioritize analysis areas to maximize insight within time constraints
- Organize findings into a clear, logical presentation

## Written Guide

### What Is a PE Case Study?

A PE case study presents you with information about a potential investment (typically a CIM or company profile) and asks you to make a recommendation: invest at the proposed price, negotiate for a lower price, or pass.

**Take-home cases** (24-48 hours): More time for deep analysis, building models, research

**Live cases** (1-2 hours): Must analyze, structure thinking, and present findings quickly

Both test: judgment, analytical rigor, communication, ability to defend under challenge.

### The Case Study Framework

Use this structure to organize your analysis:

**1. Executive Summary** (1 paragraph):
- Company overview, industry, proposed investment
- Your recommendation (invest, negotiate, pass)
- Key supporting rationale (2-3 bullets)

**2. Investment Thesis** (3-4 key points):
- Why this is an attractive investment
- Value creation opportunities
- Competitive advantages or moats

**3. Industry and Market Analysis**:
- Market size, growth trends, competitive dynamics
- Attractive or unattractive industry characteristics
- How this company is positioned

**4. Company Quality Assessment**:
- Business model, revenue drivers, competitive position
- Financial performance (revenue growth, margins, cash generation)
- Management team and track record

**5. Key Risks and Mitigants**:
- Operational, market, competitive, and financial risks
- Downside scenarios
- How risks can be addressed or monitored

**6. Valuation and Returns**:
- Entry valuation (is the price reasonable?)
- Projected returns (IRR, MOIC) under base and downside cases
- Exit path and timeline

**7. Recommendation**:
- Clear decision: invest, negotiate, or pass
- Conditions or next steps (e.g., "Invest if we can negotiate to 9× EBITDA")

### Time Management in Case Studies

**Take-home cases**:
- 30% reading and understanding the company
- 30% building financial models and valuation
- 25% qualitative analysis (industry, risks, thesis)
- 15% preparing presentation and refining recommendation

**Live cases**:
- 20% reading materials
- 30% financial analysis (quick model or back-of-envelope valuation)
- 30% identifying thesis and risks
- 20% organizing findings and preparing to present

Don't spend all your time modeling. Interviewers care more about judgment and communication than perfect Excel work.

### Common Mistakes

**Analysis paralysis**: Trying to analyze everything instead of prioritizing high-impact areas

**Weak recommendation**: Saying "it depends" or hedging instead of taking a clear position

**Ignoring risks**: Presenting only the upside without acknowledging downside

**Poor structure**: Rambling through findings instead of organizing logically

**Outline**:
- What PE case studies test: judgment, analysis, communication
- The case study framework: executive summary, thesis, industry, company quality, risks, valuation, recommendation
- Time management: how to allocate time in take-home vs. live cases
- Prioritization: focus on high-impact analysis, not everything
- Common mistakes and how to avoid them

**Suggested Length**: 14 minutes

## Key Takeaways

- PE case studies test judgment, analytical rigor, and communication under time pressure
- Use a structured framework: executive summary, investment thesis, industry analysis, company quality, risks, valuation, recommendation
- Take a clear position: invest, negotiate, or pass—don't hedge
- Prioritize high-impact analysis over exhaustive detail; interviewers value judgment over perfection
- Acknowledge both upside (thesis) and downside (risks) to demonstrate balanced thinking
- In live cases, allocate time carefully: 20% reading, 30% financials, 30% thesis and risks, 20% organizing
