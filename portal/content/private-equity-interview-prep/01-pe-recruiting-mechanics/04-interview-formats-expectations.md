# Interview Formats and Expectations

## Learning Objectives

- Explain the different interview formats used in PE recruiting: modeling tests, case studies, and fit interviews
- Understand what interviewers are evaluating in each format and how to perform effectively
- Evaluate how interview formats differ between mega-funds, middle market funds, and growth equity firms
- Identify common interview mistakes and how to avoid them

## Written Guide

### Overview of PE Interview Formats

PE interviews assess three core dimensions:

1. **Technical skills**: Can you build an LBO model correctly and quickly?
2. **Investment judgment**: Can you analyze a company, identify risks, and defend an investment recommendation?
3. **Fit and communication**: Do you understand what PE is, why you want to do it, and can you articulate your thinking clearly?

Different funds emphasize different formats, but most recruiting processes include some combination of:

- **Modeling tests** (paper LBO or Excel LBO)
- **Case studies** (live company analysis and recommendation)
- **Fit interviews** (behavioral, deal walkthroughs, "Why PE?")

### Modeling Tests

Modeling tests assess technical proficiency. They come in two forms:

**Paper LBO**:
- Handed a one-page case with financials (revenue, EBITDA, CapEx, etc.) and deal assumptions (purchase price, leverage, exit multiple)
- Asked to calculate returns (MOIC, IRR) by hand or using a basic calculator
- Time limit: 20-45 minutes
- Tests mental math, LBO intuition, and ability to work under pressure

**Excel LBO**:
- Given a CIM (Confidential Information Memorandum) or financial statements
- Asked to build a full LBO model in Excel
- Time limit: 2-3 hours
- Tests modeling mechanics, attention to detail, and ability to structure a model cleanly

**What interviewers evaluate**:
- **Accuracy**: Are your calculations correct?
- **Speed**: Can you work efficiently under time pressure?
- **Structure**: Is your model or paper work organized and easy to follow?
- **Assumptions**: Do you make reasonable assumptions when information is missing?

**Common mistakes**:
- Spending too much time on formatting and not enough on substance
- Making arithmetic errors under pressure
- Overcomplicating the model (e.g., adding unnecessary tabs or calculations)
- Not checking your work

### Case Studies

Case studies assess investment judgment. You're given information about a company and asked to make a recommendation: invest or pass.

**Format**:
- **Take-home cases**: Receive a CIM or company profile, have 24-48 hours to analyze and prepare a recommendation
- **Live cases**: Given materials in real-time, have 1-2 hours to prepare, then present findings

**What you're expected to deliver**:
- Overview of the company and industry
- Investment thesis (why this is attractive)
- Key risks and mitigants
- Valuation and returns analysis
- Recommendation (invest at this price, negotiate, or pass)

**What interviewers evaluate**:
- **Judgment**: Do you identify the right risks and opportunities?
- **Structure**: Is your analysis organized and logical?
- **Depth**: Do you go beyond surface-level observations?
- **Communication**: Can you present your thinking clearly and concisely?
- **Defensibility**: Can you handle pushback and defend your assumptions?

**Common questions during case presentations**:
- "What's your biggest concern about this investment?"
- "What would make you walk away?"
- "How would you improve this business?"
- "What if EBITDA declines 20% in Year 2?"

**Common mistakes**:
- Spending too much time on valuation mechanics and not enough on qualitative analysis
- Failing to identify key risks or downside scenarios
- Being too positive or too negative (lack of balance)
- Not having a clear recommendation
- Being defensive when challenged

### Fit Interviews

Fit interviews assess whether you understand PE, why you want to do it, and whether you'll fit the firm's culture.

**Common questions**:
- "Why private equity?"
- "Why this firm?"
- "Walk me through a deal you worked on."
- "Tell me about a recent PE transaction."
- "What makes a good LBO candidate?"
- "How would you improve [portfolio company]?"

**What interviewers evaluate**:
- **Motivation**: Is your interest in PE genuine and well-articulated?
- **Preparation**: Have you researched the firm and thought about fit?
- **Deal knowledge**: Can you discuss deals you've worked on and deals you've followed?
- **Communication**: Are you clear, concise, and confident?

**Common mistakes**:
- Generic answers ("PE offers better exposure to deals")
- Not knowing the firm's strategy, deals, or team
- Failing to discuss deals from your banking experience in depth
- Rambling or being unclear

### How Interview Formats Differ by Fund Type

**Mega-Funds**:
- Structured, multi-round process
- Almost always include a modeling test (Excel LBO)
- Case studies are common in second rounds
- Fit interviews with multiple team members
- High bar for technical and communication skills

**Middle Market Funds**:
- More variable process
- May use paper LBO instead of Excel LBO
- Case studies or live deal discussions
- Fit interviews emphasize culture fit and learning
- Slightly more flexibility on technical perfection

**Growth Equity Funds**:
- Less emphasis on LBO modeling (may not test it at all)
- Heavy emphasis on company analysis, market sizing, and growth drivers
- Case studies focused on growth potential, not leverage
- Fit interviews assess ability to work with management teams

### Interview Rounds and Sequencing

Most PE recruiting processes have 2-3 rounds:

**Round 1 (Screen)**:
- Modeling test (paper or Excel LBO)
- Initial fit interview with associate or VP
- May be combined in one session (2-3 hours)
- Filters out candidates who lack technical skills

**Round 2 (Finals)**:
- Case study (take-home or live)
- Presentation and defense of case recommendation
- Fit interviews with principals, partners, or MDs
- Assesses judgment, communication, and culture fit

**Round 3 (Optional)**:
- Additional fit interviews or case discussions
- Meet more of the team
- Often a final check before extending an offer

Some funds collapse this into fewer rounds. Others add rounds for specific assessments.

### What to Expect on Interview Day

**Logistics**:
- Interviews may be in-person (at the fund's office) or virtual
- Expect 2-4 hours of total interview time per round
- Bring a calculator, notepad, and pen (for paper LBOs or notes)
- Dress in business professional attire (suit and tie, even if the office is casual)

**Mindset**:
- Be confident but not arrogant
- Listen carefully to questions and ask for clarification if needed
- If you don't know something, admit it rather than guessing
- Treat every interaction (including with assistants or junior staff) as part of the interview

### Common Mistakes Across All Formats

**Over-preparing fit and under-preparing technical**: Candidates often spend too much time crafting "Why PE?" and not enough time on LBO modeling.

**Not practicing under time pressure**: Untimed practice doesn't replicate the stress of a real interview.

**Being unprepared for follow-up questions**: Interviewers will challenge your assumptions. Have answers ready.

**Talking too much or too little**: Be concise, but don't be so terse that you seem unprepared or uninterested.

**Not asking questions**: At the end, you'll be asked "Do you have any questions for us?" Have 2-3 thoughtful questions ready.

## Key Takeaways

- PE interviews assess technical skills (modeling), investment judgment (cases), and fit
- Modeling tests (paper or Excel LBO) evaluate speed, accuracy, and structure under time pressure
- Case studies evaluate judgment, structure, depth, and ability to defend recommendations under challenge

- Mega-funds use structured multi-round processes with high technical bars; smaller funds vary more
- Most processes have 2-3 rounds: screen (modeling + fit), finals (case + senior team), optional final check
- Common mistakes: over-preparing fit, under-preparing technical, not practicing under time pressure, being unprepared for follow-ups
