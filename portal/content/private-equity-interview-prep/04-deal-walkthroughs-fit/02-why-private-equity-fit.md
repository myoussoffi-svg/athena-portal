## Written Guide

### Why Interviewers Ask This Question

"Why private equity?" tests whether you:

**Understand the role**: Do you know what PE professionals do day-to-day?

**Have genuine interest**: Is this a thoughtful career choice, or are you following the herd?

**Are a good fit**: Do your skills, interests, and motivations align with PE?

**Can articulate your thinking**: Can you explain your rationale clearly?

### What PE Professionals Actually Do

Before answering "Why PE?", understand what the job involves:

**Deal sourcing and evaluation**: Finding investment opportunities, screening companies, building relationships

**Diligence**: Analyzing industries, companies, financials; identifying risks and opportunities

**Investment decision-making**: Building models, constructing investment theses, presenting to investment committees

**Portfolio management**: Working with management teams, tracking performance, implementing value creation plans

**Exit execution**: Preparing companies for sale, managing exit processes

The job is more strategic and ownership-oriented than banking (which is more execution and client service).

### Components of a Strong Answer

A strong "Why PE?" answer includes:

**1. What appeals to you about PE** (20-30 seconds):
- Ownership perspective: Being an investor, not an advisor
- Long-term value creation: Working with companies over 3-7 years, not 3-6 months
- Investment judgment: Making decisions about where to deploy capital
- Operational impact: Working with management to improve businesses

**2. Skills and experiences that prepared you** (15-20 seconds):
- Technical skills from banking (modeling, valuation)
- Deal exposure and understanding of how transactions work
- Analytical and judgment-building experiences

**3. What you've learned through research or conversations** (15-20 seconds):
- Conversations with PE professionals
- Understanding of how specific funds operate
- Awareness of the role's demands (long hours during deals, intense diligence)

**4. Why PE over other roles** (optional, 10-15 seconds):
- vs. Banking: More principal investing, less client service
- vs. Corporate development: More deal flow, broader exposure
- vs. Hedge funds: Longer-term, operational focus vs. trading/short-term

Total: 60-90 seconds.

### Example Answer

"I'm interested in private equity because I want to be an investor rather than an advisor. In banking, I've worked on deals from the sell-side or buy-side advisory perspective, but I want to be the one making investment decisions and living with the outcomes.

What appeals to me most about PE is the long-term nature of the work—being involved with a company over 3-7 years, working with management to create value, and seeing the results of operational improvements and strategic initiatives. I've built LBO models and analyzed dozens of companies in banking, but I want to go deeper and be responsible for whether an investment succeeds or fails.

I've spoken with several PE professionals, including [names/firms], and the combination of rigorous financial analysis, strategic thinking, and hands-on value creation aligns with what I'm looking for. I understand the role is demanding, especially during diligence and deal execution, but I'm prepared for that intensity."

This answer is specific, demonstrates research, and connects banking experience to PE.

### Distinguishing PE from Banking

Interviewers may ask: "Why not stay in banking?"

**Strong answer**:

"Banking has been an excellent training ground, and I've learned a lot about deal mechanics and financial analysis. However, I want to move from advisory to principal investing. In banking, I provide recommendations, but the client makes the decision. In PE, I'd be the decision-maker, which is more aligned with how I want to build my career. I also prefer the longer time horizon in PE—working with a company for 3-7 years rather than 3-6 months—so I can see the impact of value creation initiatives."

### Common Mistakes

**Generic answers**: "PE offers great deal exposure and exit opportunities" applies to many finance roles.

**Overemphasizing exits**: Saying "PE is the best path to hedge funds or business school" signals you're not committed.

**Not demonstrating research**: Saying "I think PE would be interesting" without having spoken to PE professionals or understanding the role.

**Confusing PE with banking**: Describing PE as "working on more deals" when in reality, PE involves fewer deals but deeper involvement.

**Being too negative about banking**: "I hate client service" sounds immature. Frame it positively: "I prefer principal investing."
