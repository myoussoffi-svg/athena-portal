# Final Preparation and Interview Day Strategy

## Learning Objectives

- Understand interview day logistics and how to manage multiple back-to-back interviews
- Execute a strategy for staying composed, energized, and focused during long interview days
- Handle post-interview follow-up and decision-making effectively

## Written Guide

### Final Week Preparation Checklist

**Technical Review**:
- Run 2-3 full LBO models from scratch (Excel) under time pressure
- Complete 3-5 paper LBOs and check answers
- Review key assumptions: how to size debt, set exit multiples, calculate MOIC/IRR
- Refresh accounting and valuation concepts (three statements, DCF, comps)

**Case Study Practice**:
- Run 1-2 full case studies (take-home or live format)
- Practice presenting recommendations and defending under challenge
- Review frameworks: industry analysis, company quality, risks, investment thesis

**Fit Preparation**:
- Practice "Why PE?", "Why this firm?", "Walk me through a deal" out loud
- Prepare 4-6 thoughtful questions for interviewers
- Review your resume and be ready to discuss every line in detail
- Research the firm: recent deals, portfolio companies, team members

**Mental Preparation**:
- Get adequate sleep (especially the night before)
- Plan logistics: know the address, plan to arrive 15 minutes early
- Prepare materials: resume copies, notepad, pen, calculator (if needed)

### Interview Day Logistics

**Before You Arrive**:
- Dress in business professional attire (suit and tie for men, suit or professional equivalent for women)
- Silence your phone completely (not just vibrate)
- Review your notes on the firm one final time
- Arrive 15 minutes early, but not more (don't loiter in the lobby for 30 minutes)

**During the Interview**:
- Greet everyone professionally, including receptionists and assistants
- Maintain eye contact, sit up straight, project confidence
- Listen carefully to questions; ask for clarification if needed
- Take brief notes if helpful, but don't let note-taking distract from engagement

**Between Interviews** (if multiple rounds in one day):
- Use breaks to decompress, hydrate, and refocus
- Don't overthink previous rounds; focus on the next one
- If you made a mistake in an earlier round, let it go

**After Interviews**:
- Send thank-you emails within 24 hours to each interviewer (personalized, not templated)
- Reference something specific from your conversation
- Keep it brief (3-4 sentences)

### Managing Energy and Composure

PE interview days can be exhausting—3-4 hours of back-to-back modeling, cases, and fit questions. To stay sharp:

**Pace yourself**: Don't expend all your energy in the first hour. Treat it like a marathon, not a sprint.

**Stay hydrated**: Drink water during breaks. Avoid too much caffeine, which can make you jittery.

**Reset between rounds**: Take a deep breath, clear your mind, and focus on the next interviewer.

**Don't dwell on mistakes**: If you make an error, acknowledge it, move on, and don't let it affect the rest of the interview.

**Be consistent**: Treat every interviewer with the same level of professionalism and enthusiasm, whether they're an analyst or a partner.

### Handling Difficult or Unexpected Questions

**If you don't know the answer**: "I'm not sure about that specific detail, but here's how I'd approach it..." or "I don't know, but I'd want to research [X] to answer that question."

**If the interviewer is tough or skeptical**: Stay calm, don't take it personally, and defend your thinking clearly. Some interviewers deliberately push to see how you handle pressure.

**If you're asked to change assumptions mid-interview**: Think through the mechanics out loud, even if you can't calculate precisely.

### Post-Interview: Offers and Decisions

**Exploding offers**: PE offers often have short decision windows (48-96 hours). This forces you to decide quickly.

**How to decide**:
- Culture and team: Did you connect with the people? Do they seem supportive?
- Learning: Will you get mentorship, responsibility, and skill development?
- Deal focus: Are you excited about the sectors, deal sizes, and investment strategy?
- Reputation and exit opportunities: Does this position you well for the next step?

**Don't solely chase brand names**: A top-tier fund with bad culture or limited learning may be worse than a strong middle-market fund with great mentorship.

**Negotiate if needed**: If you have multiple offers, it's reasonable to ask for 1-2 extra days to decide. Most firms will accommodate.

**Decline gracefully**: If you decline an offer, do so respectfully. The PE world is small, and you may encounter these people again.

### Common Mistakes

**Arriving late or unprepared**: This is disqualifying.

**Being overly nervous or apologetic**: Confidence (not arrogance) is important.

**Not asking questions at the end**: "No questions" signals disinterest.

**Sending generic thank-you emails**: Personalize each one.

**Dwelling on mistakes**: If you make an error, move on.

**Making rash decisions**: Don't accept an offer without thinking through fit, learning, and culture.
